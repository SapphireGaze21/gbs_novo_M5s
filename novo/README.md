# AI-Powered Market Analysis for Wegovy in India 

[cite_start]This project, developed by **Team 'the m5s'**, presents a data-driven solution to inform the commercial strategy for Wegovy in India[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]We use an AI-powered platform to transform diverse, unstructured data from medical papers and national health surveys into an interactive analytics dashboard[cite: 11, 12].

[cite_start]The platform provides crucial insights into obesity prevalence, patient profiles, and treatment patterns, enabling precise market segmentation, optimized pricing, and accurate demand forecasting for Novo Nordisk[cite: 12, 17].

## Project Objective

[cite_start]To conduct a comprehensive market analysis that quantifies obesity prevalence, patient profiles, and treatment patterns in India, providing data-driven insights to inform the commercial strategy for Wegovy[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Our goal is to empower both Novo Nordisk with a clear go-to-market strategy and the community with data for targeted public health initiatives[cite: 17, 18].

##  Key Features

Our Health Data Analytics Platform is built on three core pillars:

1.  [cite_start]**üß† ML Insights**: Delivers obesity prevalence forecasts with machine learning predictions and interactive visualizations across Indian states and districts[cite: 29, 56].
2.  [cite_start]**üìä EDA Dashboard**: An exploratory data analysis tool for NFHS-5 health indicators, featuring interactive filtering and dynamic charts to explore demographic and health data[cite: 56].
3.  [cite_start]**üîé NLP Insights**: Leverages semantic search and AI-powered document summarization to analyze medical literature and extract insights that keyword searches would miss[cite: 26, 56].

## Live Demo & Screenshots

Here is a preview of the interactive dashboard, which serves as the primary interface for exploring the project's findings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

[cite_start]We implemented a three-step pipeline to transform scattered information into a powerful strategic tool[cite: 20].

#### 1. Ingest & Clean
[cite_start]We gathered unstructured data from sources like **PubMed, NFHS, and WHO reports**[cite: 22]. [cite_start]An NLP pipeline then cleaned and structured this information for analysis[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]**Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, SpaCy (for NER and text cleaning)[cite: 24].

#### 2. Analyze & Understand
[cite_start]We used advanced AI to cluster documents and perform semantic searches, uncovering hidden themes and relationships in the data[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**Tech Stack**: Hugging Face (for embeddings), MongoDB (vector database), Scikit-learn (K-Means, DBSCAN)[cite: 27].

#### 3. Predict & Visualize
[cite_start]We trained machine learning models to forecast future obesity trends and presented the insights in a dynamic, interactive dashboard[cite: 29].
* **Tech Stack**: Scikit-learn & TensorFlow (predictive modeling); [cite_start]React & D3.js (interactive dashboard)[cite: 30].

## üí° Key Insights & Commercial Strategy

Our analysis uncovered several key findings that directly inform a targeted commercial strategy for Wegovy.

### Key Insights

* [cite_start]**Geographic Hotspots**: Punjab, Delhi, and Chandigarh are predicted to have the highest obesity rates, exceeding 38%[cite: 35].
* [cite_start]**Urban-Rural Divide**: Predicted obesity among females is significantly higher in urban areas (33.8%) compared to rural areas (23.9%)[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]**High Co-morbidity**: A strong correlation exists between high blood pressure and high blood sugar, identifying a clear patient profile for Wegovy[cite: 38, 39].
* [cite_start]**Market Access Gaps**: A digital divide for women and low health insurance coverage are significant barriers to access[cite: 41, 42].

### Recommended Commercial Strategy

1.  [cite_start]**Prioritize High-Potential Markets**: Focus sales and marketing efforts on top-tier urban hotspots like Delhi and Punjab[cite: 45].
2.  [cite_start]**Position for Co-morbid Patients**: Target healthcare professional education on Wegovy's benefits for patients with hypertension and other related risks[cite: 47].
3.  [cite_start]**Optimize Pricing & Access**: Develop tiered pricing and Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) to overcome affordability barriers[cite: 49].
4.  [cite_start]**Launch a Female-Focused Digital Program**: Create a mobile-first (WhatsApp/SMS) support program to bypass the digital access gap for women[cite: 51].
5.  [cite_start]**Execute a Phased Pilot Launch**: Engage Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in 3-5 high-potential states to build advocacy and guide a targeted rollout[cite: 53].
