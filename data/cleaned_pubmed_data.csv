"The global, regional, and national burden attributable to low bone mineral density, 1990-2020: an analysis of a modifiable risk factor from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","Fractures related to osteoporosis and low bone mineral density lead to substantial morbidity, mortality, and cost to individuals and health systems. Here we present the most up-to-date global, regional, and national estimates of the contribution of low bone mineral density to the burden of fractures from falls and additional categories of injuries from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021. The burden of low bone mineral density was estimated from 1990 to 2020 in terms of years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and deaths, for individuals aged 40 years and older, using data from population-based studies from 48 countries or territories (169 unique sources). Mean standardised femoral neck bone mineral density values were estimated by GBD location, age, and sex by meta-regression. Based on a separate meta-analysis of population-based studies from nine countries (12 unique sources), we also estimated the pooled relative risk of fractures per unit decrease in bone mineral density (g/cm<sup>2</sup>). The population-attributable fraction for low bone mineral density was calculated by comparing the observed distributions of standardised femoral neck bone mineral density to an age-specific and sex-specific counterfactual distribution, defined as the 99th percentile of five rounds of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA, by 5-year age group and sex. Hospital and emergency department data were used to derive the incidence of fractures for six categories of injury (road injuries, other transport injuries, falls, non-venomous animal contact, exposure to mechanical forces, and physical interpersonal violence) using ICD codes. Deaths due to fractures were estimated as the proportion of in-hospital deaths due to the specified injury causes for which a fracture (nature of injury code) was more severe than the cause of injury code. YLDs and DALYs attributable to low bone mineral density by cause of injury were also determined according to previous GBD methods. In 2020, 8·32 million (95% UI 5·58-10·84) YLDs, 17·2 million (14·1-20·2) DALYs, and 477 000 (411 000-536 000) deaths were attributable to low bone mineral density globally in individuals aged 40 years and older. Between 1990 and 2020, global YLDs, DALYs, and deaths attributable to low bone mineral density increased by 91·8% (88·5-95·1), 89·8% (81·5-99·0), and 127·1% (108·5-144·5), respectively. Over this period, the age-standardised global rates of YLDs, DALYs, and deaths attributable to low bone mineral density showed modest decreases. In 2020, falls accounted for 76·2% (95% UI 74·2-78·3) of YLDs, 65·2% (62·9-67·6) of DALYs, and 71·0% (67·4-72·8) of deaths attributable to low bone mineral density, and road injuries largely accounted for the remaining amount: 12·4% (11·1-13·6) of YLDs, 24·6% (22·5-27·1) of DALYs, and 23·1% (21·6-26·2) of deaths. As a proportion of all fall-related burden, low bone mineral density accounted for 26·6% (23·2-28·7) of YLDs, 25·6% (22·1-27·4) of DALYs, and 40·6% (35·4-44·0) of deaths in 2020. Of all road injury-related burden, 12·6% (10·8-13·5) of YLDs, 6·3% (5·4-6·9) of DALYs, and 8·9% (7·6-9·6) of deaths were attributable to low bone mineral density. In men, road injuries accounted for the largest proportion of DALYs attributable to low bone mineral density in those aged 40-59 years and the largest proportion of deaths in those aged 40-64 years. In women, road injuries were the leading cause of DALYs attributable to low bone mineral density in those aged 40-44 years and the leading cause of deaths attributable to low bone mineral density in those aged 40-54 years. In older age groups among both men and women, falls were the leading cause of the burden attributable to low bone mineral density. Low bone mineral density is a crucial modifiable risk factor for fractures, which are an important cause of morbidity and mortality particularly in ageing populations. This analysis highlights low bone mineral density as a cause of health loss not just from falls, but also from road injuries.

"Monitoring Survey of Cancer Risk Factors and Health System Response in Northeast Region, Mizoram.","The incidence of mortality and cumulative risk of developing cancer has been consistently high in the northeastern Region of India. Cancer is among the leading causes of death in Mizoram. This survey is an approach to implement a baseline monitoring system to drive us in understanding the linkage between exposures to risk factors, other noncommunicable diseases, and cancer incidence. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2880 households from 60 primary sampling units who were selected using a multistage cluster sampling technique. The data were collected using household level interview, adult interview, cancer patient interview, and health facility interview. Nearly half of the respondents had a clustering of >3 cancer risk factors. The prevalence of current tobacco use (smoked or smokeless) was as high as 77.1%. Over 80% of the respondents consumed fermented products. Nearly half of the respondents were prehypertensive. 35.9% of the respondents were overweight. Nearly 41.3% of the respondents had central obesity. Around 42.8% of the respondents were aware of cancer screening. Less than 25% of the surveyed primary health cares provided cancer screening services. The high prevalence of cancer risk factors underscores the urgent need for comprehensive and sustained efforts toward prevention, education, and intervention. The challenges posed by a poor health system for cancer prevention are grave and demand urgent attention from all stakeholders involved in health-care delivery.",incidence mortality cumulative risk develop cancer consistently high northeastern region india cancer lead cause death mizoram survey approach implement baseline monitoring system drive understand linkage exposure risk factor noncommunicable disease cancer incidence cross sectional study conduct household primary sampling unit select multistage cluster sampling technique datum collect household level interview adult interview cancer patient interview health facility interview nearly half respondent clustering cancer risk factor prevalence current tobacco use smoked smokeless high respondent consume ferment product nearly half respondent prehypertensive respondent overweight nearly respondent central obesity respondent aware cancer screening survey primary health care provide cancer screening service high prevalence cancer risk factor underscore urgent need comprehensive sustained effort prevention education intervention challenge pose poor health system cancer prevention grave demand urgent attention stakeholder involve health care delivery
"Unveiling the Inflammatory Connections: Evaluating Anthropometric and Bio-impedance Indices as Prognostic Indicators of Inflammation through the Dietary Inflammatory Index among Government Doctors in Gujarat, India - A Cross-sectional Study.","Obesity and chronic inflammation increase metabolic disease risk. This study investigated associations between inflammation, body composition, and dietary patterns in Indian physicians. In this cross-sectional study, 550 government doctors aged 25-60 years in Gujarat, India, were recruited through multistage random sampling. Anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and food frequency questionnaire data were collected. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores were calculated. High obesity prevalence was observed, with 48% classified as obese by body fat percentage (BF%) despite normal body mass index (BMI). Significant positive correlations were found between DII scores and BF% (r = 0.57, P < 0.001) and BMI (r = 0.27, P < 0.001). DII scores were negatively correlated with skeletal muscle percent (r = -0.45, P < 0.001). Higher body fat raised the odds of elevated DII by 1.121 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.22, P < 0.001), while higher muscle percent lowered DII odds by 0.910 (95% CI 0.85-0.964, P < 0.001). Excess adiposity correlated with higher dietary inflammation among Indian physicians, contrasting with lower inflammation linked to greater muscle mass.

Tackling the Growing Concern-Overweight and Obesity among Adolescents in India: An Analysis of National Institute of Nutrition Data.,"The escalating prevalence of overweight and obesity among Indian adolescents present a critical public health challenge requiring urgent attention and effective interventions. This study analyzes data from the National Institute of Nutrition's (NINs) Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) (2016-2018) to provide a comprehensive assessment of this issue. Recognizing the limitations of universal classifications, we utilize body mass index (BMI) cutoffs specifically adapted for the Indian/South East Asian population, offering a more accurate representation of weight status in this vulnerable group. Employing a quantitative approach with secondary data analysis, our study examines a nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 10-19 years. Anthropometric measurements of weight, height, and BMI were collected and analyzed using the specific Indian/South East Asian criteria to categorize participants. Statistical analyses, including Chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression, were conducted using SPSS to explore prevalence, trends, and associated factors. Findings reveal a statistically significant increase in overweight and obesity among Indian adolescents between 2006 and 2014 (<i>p</i> < 0.001), highlighting a concerning trend. Multivariate analysis identified male sex, urban residence, and increased screen time as significant predictors of overweight and obesity based on the adapted criteria. Conversely, higher parental education and engaging in moderate to increased physical activity were associated with decreased odds. These results underscore the need for targeted interventions addressing socioeconomic disparities, urban-rural differences, and lifestyle factors. Promoting physical activity, reducing screen time, and increasing parental awareness, particularly among urban male adolescents, are crucial. A comprehensive approach involving schools, communities, and public health policies is essential to combat this growing public health concern and foster a healthier future for Indian adolescents.",escalate prevalence overweight obesity indian adolescent present critical public health challenge require urgent attention effective intervention study analyze datum national institute nutrition nin comprehensive national nutrition survey cnns provide comprehensive assessment issue recognize limitation universal classification utilize body mass index bmi cutoff specifically adapt indian south east asian population offer accurate representation weight status vulnerable group employ quantitative approach secondary datum analysis study examine nationally representative sample adolescent age year anthropometric measurement weight height bmi collect analyze specific indian south east asian criterion categorize participant statistical analysis include chi square test multivariate logistic regression conduct spss explore prevalence trend associate factor finding reveal statistically significant increase overweight obesity indian adolescent highlight concern trend multivariate analysis identify male sex urban residence increase screen time significant predictor overweight obesity base adapt criterion conversely high parental education engage moderate increase physical activity associate decrease odd result underscore need target intervention address socioeconomic disparity urban rural difference lifestyle factor promote physical activity reduce screen time increase parental awareness particularly urban male adolescent crucial comprehensive approach involve school community public health policy essential combat grow public health concern foster healthy future indian adolescent
A Multispecialty Consensus on Individualized Treatment Strategies for Hypertension Phenotypes and Comorbidities.,"Hypertension (HTN) remains a leading contributor to global morbidity and mortality, often coexisting with major comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), and obesity. In India, a significant proportion of hypertensive individuals remain undiagnosed or inadequately treated. This multispecialty consensus provides comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for individualized HTN management tailored to specific phenotypes and comorbidities. Developed through structured expert panel discussions and a review of international and national guidelines, the consensus emphasizes out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring, phenotype recognition (e.g., white-coat, masked, nocturnal HTN), and early detection of target organ damage. The document outlines practical algorithms and a therapeutic wheel to guide antihypertensive therapy based on patient-specific factors, promoting use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers (BB), and diuretics, as per clinical context. Special considerations are provided for managing HTN in young adults, patients with tachycardia, stroke, and respiratory disorders. The consensus also advocates for lifestyle modifications, treatment adherence, and multidisciplinary care to improve BP control and long-term outcomes. By promoting a holistic, patient-centered approach, this consensus aims to bridge gaps in clinical practice and standardize the management of HTN in diverse healthcare settings.",hypertension htn remain lead contributor global morbidity mortality coexist major comorbiditie diabetes chronic kidney disease ckd coronary artery disease cad heart failure hf obesity india significant proportion hypertensive individual remain undiagnosed inadequately treat multispecialty consensus provide comprehensive evidence base recommendation individualized htn management tailor specific phenotype comorbiditie develop structured expert panel discussion review international national guideline consensus emphasize office blood pressure bp monitoring phenotype recognition white coat mask nocturnal htn early detection target organ damage document outline practical algorithm therapeutic wheel guide antihypertensive therapy base patient specific factor promote use angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor acei angiotensin receptor blocker arb calcium channel blocker ccbs beta blocker bb diuretic clinical context special consideration provide manage htn young adult patient tachycardia stroke respiratory disorder consensus advocate lifestyle modification treatment adherence multidisciplinary care improve bp control long term outcome promote holistic patient center approach consensus aim bridge gap clinical practice standardize management htn diverse healthcare setting
Prevalence of Hypertension in Young Adults in Punjab.,"India has shown dramatic increase in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), so much so that about 70% of the overall mortality is estimated to be because of NCDs. Young adults <35 years of age constitute 65%, a significant section of Indian population, but there is paucity of studies exploring prevalence of HTN among young adults in India, especially in Punjab. So, the present study was conducted to know the prevalence of HTN among young adults in Punjab. This observational study was conducted as part of a global blood pressure (BP) screening program, after approval from Institutional Ethics Committee. Subjects of 18-80 years were included after verbal informed consent. Data obtained was analyzed as per the standard statistical method, and Chi-squared test was applied. A total of 24,685 participants completed the study including 43.5% young adults. The prevalence of HTN in young adults was 9.2 and 18.8% in older adults. About 71.8% hypertensive young adults were overweight or obese. Males demonstrated 16.7% prevalence of HTN as compared to 12.3% in females, whereas in young adults 28.4% females had HTN as compared to 26.6% males. Present study documents increase in prevalence of HTN among young adults and its association with overweight and obesity necessitating initiation of HTN prevention and control strategies, especially focused on young adults.",india show dramatic increase noncommunicable disease ncds overall mortality estimate ncds young adult year age constitute significant section indian population paucity study explore prevalence htn young adult india especially punjab present study conduct know prevalence htn young adult punjab observational study conduct global blood pressure bp screening program approval institutional ethic committee subject year include verbal inform consent datum obtain analyze standard statistical method chi square test apply total participant complete study include young adult prevalence htn young adult old adult hypertensive young adult overweight obese male demonstrate prevalence htn compare female young adult female htn compare male present study document increase prevalence htn young adult association overweight obesity necessitating initiation htn prevention control strategy especially focus young adult
Revised Diagnostic Criteria for Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia-The VasCog-2-WSO Criteria.,"Several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). The International Society for Vascular Behavioural and Cognitive Disorders (VasCog) working group published comprehensive operationalized criteria in 2014. Considering subsequent advances in the field, a revision was needed. To update the VasCog criteria to achieve consensus on diagnosis of VCID. VasCog criteria and other published diagnostic guidelines, aided by literature review of recent developments in VCID, were used as reference points for an online Delphi survey (minimum 3 rounds, ≥75% threshold for agreement), including operationalization of criteria and guidance on potential biomarkers. Seventy international experts from diverse international regions were invited to participate in 2023. Three survey rounds included 49 to 54 participants that agreed on VasCog-2 diagnostic criteria for preclinical, mild, and major dementia levels of vascular cognitive impairment (under the overarching term VCID). Research guidelines, including the use of novel neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers, were also agreed on. The World Stroke Organization (WSO) endorsed the criteria, hence named VasCog-2-WSO. The VasCog-2-WSO criteria update the VasCog criteria for the diagnosis of VCID, providing operationalization and additional guidance on potential neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers. VasCog-2-WSO should provide an international standard for VCID diagnosis, facilitating diagnostic consistency among clinicians and researchers.",set diagnostic criterion propose vascular cognitive impairment dementia vcid international society vascular behavioural cognitive disorder vascog working group publish comprehensive operationalized criterion consider subsequent advance field revision need update vascog criterion achieve consensus diagnosis vcid vascog criterion publish diagnostic guideline aid literature review recent development vcid reference point online delphi survey minimum round threshold agreement include operationalization criterion guidance potential biomarker seventy international expert diverse international region invite participate survey round include participant agree diagnostic criterion preclinical mild major dementia level vascular cognitive impairment overarch term vcid research guideline include use novel neuroimaging fluid biomarker agree world stroke organization wso endorse criterion name wso wso criterion update vascog criterion diagnosis vcid provide operationalization additional guidance potential neuroimaging fluid biomarker wso provide international standard vcid diagnosis facilitate diagnostic consistency clinician researcher
Estimating the Burden of Sarcopenia in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Implications for Metabolic Health.,"Background Sarcopenia, the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, is a significant complication in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that worsens insulin resistance and glycemic control. Techniques such as a bioimpedance analyzer, handgrip strength (HGS) tests, and gait speed assessments serve to assess sarcopenia. Aim The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of T2DM patients with sarcopenia (T2DMS+) compared with non-diabetic patients and assess the association between sarcopenia and obesity in T2DM patients. Materials and methods For this observational cross-sectional study, all diabetic and non-diabetic male and female patients in the age group of 18-60 years were recruited during their routine outpatient visits. Sarcopenia was assessed using a bioimpedance analyzer for muscle mass, a handgrip dynamometer for muscle strength, and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score for physical performance. Observation and results This study compared the prevalence and impact of sarcopenia in T2DM patients and non-diabetic patients. The study population included 100 T2DM patients and 100 controls. The mean age of the T2DM group (T2DMG) was 47.79 ± 8.64 years, slightly higher than that of the control group (CG), which was 44.31 ± 9.56 years. The gender distribution was consistent, with 70% (n = 70) of female patients and 30% (n = 30) of male patients in both groups. The body mass index (BMI) was similar between the T2DMG (25.9 ± 4.91 kg/m²) and the CG (26.76 ± 5.84 kg/m², p = 0.10). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were markedly higher in the T2DMG (8.05 ± 1.47%) compared with the CG (5.52 ± 0.65%, p < 0.05). Sarcopenia was significantly more prevalent in the T2DM group (53%, n = 53/100) than in the control group (17%, n = 17/100) with an odds ratio of 5.54 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.84-10.81, p < 0.001), and more frequent in obese diabetics (64.15%, n = 34/53) compared to non-obese diabetics (35.85%, n = 19/53) with an odds ratio of 3.41 (95% CI: 1.38-8.39, p = 0.0001). Compared with the non-sarcopenic T2DM patients (47%, n = 47), sarcopenic T2DM patients (53%, n = 53) were older (52 ± 7.61 years and 43.02 ± 7.17 years, respectively, p < 0.05) and had longer diabetes duration (8.45 ± 5.45 years, p < 0.05). The sarcopenic T2DM patients also had less appendicular lean mass (ALM) (18.5 ± 4.14 kg compared with 21.19 ± 3.95 kg, p < 0.0014), reduced HGS (14.97 ± 3.83 kg compared with 25.78 ± 4.34 kg, p < 0.05), lower SPPB scores (6.49 ± 1.4 compared with 10.06 ± 0.76, p < 0.05), and higher HbA1c (8.54 ± 1% compared with 7.5 ± 1.47%, p = 0.00037). Conclusion T2DM patients exhibited lower appendicular lean mass, muscle strength, and physical performance, and had significantly lower handgrip strength and SPPB scores than the non-sarcopenic T2DM patients. Further, sarcopenia was more pronounced in the older patients and those with a longer duration of diabetes.",background sarcopenia progressive loss muscle mass strength significant complication type diabetes mellitus dm worsen insulin resistance glycemic control technique bioimpedance analyzer handgrip strength hgs test gait speed assessment serve assess sarcopenia aim aim study determine proportion dm patient sarcopenia compare non diabetic patient assess association sarcopenia obesity dm patient material method observational cross sectional study diabetic non diabetic male female patient age group year recruit routine outpatient visit sarcopenia assess bioimpedance analyzer muscle mass handgrip dynamometer muscle strength short physical performance battery sppb score physical performance observation result study compare prevalence impact sarcopenia dm patient non diabetic patient study population include dm patient control mean age dm group year slightly high control group cg year gender distribution consistent n female patient n male patient group body mass index bmi similar kg cg kg p hemoglobin level markedly high compare cg p sarcopenia significantly prevalent dm group n control group n odd ratio confidence interval ci p frequent obese diabetic n compare non obese diabetic n odd ratio ci p compare non sarcopenic dm patient n sarcopenic dm patient n old year year respectively p long diabete duration year p sarcopenic dm patient appendicular lean mass alm kg compare kg p reduce hgs kg compare kg p low sppb score compare p high compare p conclusion dm patient exhibit low appendicular lean mass muscle strength physical performance significantly low handgrip strength sppb score non sarcopenic dm patient sarcopenia pronounced old patient long duration diabetes
Assessment of Serum Uric Acid Levels Among Gestational Diabetes Patients in Erbil City.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common obstetrical disorder with a significant impact on maternal and fetal well-being. This study aimed to assess serum uric acid levels in pregnant women with GDM and determine their diagnostic performance. A case-control study was conducted at Erbil Maternity Hospital and primary health care units from May to December 2024, involving 200 pregnant women (100 with GDM and 100 healthy controls). Sociodemographic, obstetric, dietary, and laboratory data were collected. Serum uric acid was measured using the uricase method, and its association with GDM was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Serum uric acid demonstrated excellent discriminative ability for GDM (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.940). The optimal cut-off value of 3.15 mg/dL yielded 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Women with uric acid ≥ 3.15 mg/dL had 122.8-fold higher odds of GDM (odds ratio (OR) = 122.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 34.4-437.8, p < 0.001) after adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), and gestational age; each 1 mg/dL increase was associated with a 30.7-fold increase in odds (OR = 30.7, 95% CI: 10.9-86.3, p < 0.001). Elevated uric acid was present in 90% of women with GDM compared to 11% of controls. This prevalence is higher than that reported in Egypt (54.7%) and India (74.7%). Higher BMI, grand multiparity, positive family history of diabetes, and reduced plant-based food intake were also significantly associated with GDM. Elevated serum uric acid is strongly associated with GDM, with a cut-off of 3.15 mg/dL providing high diagnostic accuracy. The prevalence observed was higher than in several international studies. Limitations include the facility-based design, lack of adjustment for diet and renal function in the analysis, and potential recall bias.",gestational diabete mellitus gdm common obstetrical disorder significant impact maternal fetal study aim assess serum uric acid level pregnant woman gdm determine diagnostic performance case control study conduct erbil maternity hospital primary health care unit december involve pregnant woman gdm healthy control sociodemographic obstetric dietary laboratory datum collect serum uric acid measure uricase method association gdm evaluate receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis multivariable logistic regression serum uric acid demonstrate excellent discriminative ability gdm area curve auc optimal cut value mg dl yield sensitivity specificity woman uric acid mg dl fold high odd gdm odd ratio confidence interval ci p adjust age body mass index bmi gestational age mg dl increase associate fold increase odd ci p elevated uric acid present woman gdm compare control prevalence high report egypt india high bmi grand multiparity positive family history diabetes reduce plant base food intake significantly associate gdm elevated serum uric acid strongly associate gdm cut mg dl provide high diagnostic accuracy prevalence observe high international study limitation include facility base design lack adjustment diet renal function analysis potential recall bias
Efficacy and Safety of GLP-1 RAs in Children and Adolescents With Obesity or Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Obesity affects 1 in 5 children and adolescents, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are among the few pharmacotherapy options available for this population, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy and safety. To assess the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs in children and adolescents (<18 years) with obesity, prediabetes, or T2D. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published from inception until February 28, 2025. Data analysis was completed from January 2025 to April 2025. RCTs comparing GLP-1 RAs to placebo in children and adolescents with obesity, overweight, prediabetes, or T2D with reported safety and efficacy data were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data on sample size, population, interventions, follow-up, and outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2). Efficacy outcomes (except lipids) were analyzed as estimated treatment differences, lipids as estimated treatment ratios, and safety via rate ratios. A random-effects inverse variance model was used for all outcomes. The primary efficacy outcomes were change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (in percentage points), fasting glucose (in milligrams per deciliter), body weight (in kilograms), body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), BMI z scores or percentiles, BMI standard deviation score (SDS), lipid outcomes, and blood pressure. Exploratory efficacy outcomes included obstructive sleep apnea and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Safety outcomes included gastrointestinal adverse effects (GI AEs), infections, hepatobiliary disorders, suicidal ideation or behaviors, depression, hypoglycemia, and adverse event discontinuations. A total of 18 RCTs (11 in obesity, 6 in T2D, and 1 in prediabetes) with 1402 participants (838 GLP-1 RA users and 564 placebo) were included (mean [range] age, 13.7 [6-17] years; 831 female participants (59.3%); median [IQR] treatment duration, 0.51 [0.25-1.00] years). GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced HbA1c (-0.44%; 95% CI, -0.68% to -0.21%), fasting glucose (-9.92 mg/dL; 95% CI, -16.20 to -3.64), body weight (-3.02 kg; 95% CI, -4.98 to -1.06), BMI (-1.45; 95% CI, -2.40 to -0.49), BMI SDS (-0.20; 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.05), BMI percentile (-7.24%; 95% CI, -12.97% to -1.51%), and systolic blood pressure (-2.73 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.04 to -1.43) and increased GI AE (log[rate ratio] [RR], 0.75). Other AEs, including suicidal ideation or behaviors, showed no significant differences. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 trials, GLP-1 RAs significantly improved glycemic, weight, and cardiometabolic outcomes in children and adolescents with T2D or obesity. Available data over a relatively short follow-up suggested suicidal ideation or behaviors were not significantly different, although GI AEs warrant attention in long-term management.",obesity affect child adolescent increase risk type diabetes glucagon like receptor agonist ra pharmacotherapy option available population necessitate comprehensive evaluation efficacy safety assess efficacy safety ras child adolescent year obesity prediabete systematic search conduct pubmed embase cochrane central register control trial central randomize clinical trial rct publish inception february datum analysis complete january april rct compare ras placebo child adolescent obesity overweight prediabete report safety efficacy datum include reviewer independently extract datum sample size population intervention follow outcome risk bias assess version cochrane risk bias tool efficacy outcome lipid analyze estimate treatment difference lipid estimate treatment ratio safety rate ratio random effect inverse variance model outcome primary efficacy outcome change hemoglobin percentage point fast glucose milligram deciliter body weight kilogram body mass index bmi calculate weight kilogram divide height meter square bmi z score percentile bmi standard deviation score sds lipid outcome blood pressure exploratory efficacy outcome include obstructive sleep apnea metabolic dysfunction associate steatohepatitis metabolic dysfunction associate steatotic liver disease safety outcome include gastrointestinal adverse effect gi aes infection hepatobiliary disorder suicidal ideation behavior depression hypoglycemia adverse event discontinuation total rct obesity prediabete participant ra user placebo include mean range age year female participant median iqr treatment duration year ras significantly reduce ci fast glucose mg dl ci body weight kg ci bmi ci bmi sds ci bmi percentile ci systolic blood pressure mm hg ci increase gi ae ratio rr aes include suicidal ideation behavior show significant difference systematic review meta analysis trial ras significantly improve glycemic weight cardiometabolic outcome child adolescent obesity available datum relatively short follow suggest suicidal ideation behavior significantly different gi aes warrant attention long term management
Urban-Rural Health Transitions in India: A Comprehensive Review of Non-communicable Disease Trends and Risk Landscapes.,"India is experiencing a dual burden of non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors, with distinct patterns emerging across rural and urban geographies. While behavioral risks such as tobacco and alcohol use remain entrenched in rural settings, urban populations are disproportionately affected by metabolic risks such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. This review aims to synthesize national data to understand the geographic divergence of NCD risk factors and their implications for public health policy. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using data from the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS-4 and NFHS-5), the National Noncommunicable Disease Monitoring Survey (NNMS), and the Indian Council of Medical Research - India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study. Risk factors were categorized into behavioral (e.g., tobacco use and alcohol consumption), metabolic (e.g., hypertension, overweight, and raised blood sugar), and biochemical (e.g., dyslipidemia) domains. Comparative analyses were performed across urban and rural populations to assess temporal trends and disparities. The review showed that rural populations demonstrated a higher prevalence of tobacco use (42.7% in rural men vs. 28.8% in urban men) and alcohol consumption, while urban populations had higher rates of physical inactivity, overweight, hypertension, and raised blood sugar. Obesity among rural women is also rising, indicating a shifting nutrition transition. Biochemical risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia were more prevalent in urban areas but remain underdiagnosed across both geographies. India's NCD burden is characterized by a clear urban-rural divide in risk factor prevalence, necessitating geographically differentiated policy responses. Public health strategies must integrate behavior change in rural areas and metabolic risk management in urban settings, while addressing gender and equity gaps.

Prevalence of Overweight/Obesity Among Under-Five Children in Lower Middle-Income Countries and Assessment of the Reported Associated Factors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Overweight/obesity among children under five is a growing global concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet consolidated evidence of this burden remains limited, which is crucial to target interventions. This review synthesises data from community-based studies to estimate the overall and individual pooled prevalences of overweight/obesity in this population and explores the factors associated. PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE were searched and screened for eligible studies published between April 2014 and 2024 individually by two researchers. Quality assessment of the eligible studies was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool. Data regarding the prevalence of overweight, obesity and their associated factors, including maternal education, area of residence, maternal body weight, household incomes and breastfeeding practices, as reported in these included studies, were extracted. A random-effect model was used for the meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was evaluated using I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analyses comparing effect sizes across categories of geographic regions, overweight/obesity measurement guidelines, sample sizes and publication years. Meta-regression assessed the relationship between these variables and the pooled estimates. Of the 13 734 studies screened, 21 were eligible for inclusion. The pooled prevalence of overweight/obesity among the under-five children in LMICs was 8.57% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.24-12.63, I<sup>2</sup> 100% at p value < 0.01) with significant heterogeneity. Overnutrition prevalence increased from 7.43% during the 5 years of 2014-2018 to 9.12% during 2019-2023. The pooled prevalence of overweight/obesity varied significantly across geography, with the highest prevalence in the African region (17%) and the lowest in the Southeast Asian region (3.41%). Across the four studies that reported maternal education, children of mothers with secondary school education or higher had increased odds of having overweight/obesity [Odds Ratio (OR) (95% CI): 1.51 (1.21-1.88)]. Prevalence estimates also differed significantly by gender, with 6.89% for under-five boys and 4.75% for girls [OR (95% CI): 1.48 (1.08-2.04)]. Although individual studies reported significant associations with other factors such as area of residence, maternal body weight, income status and breastfeeding practices, a meta-analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity. Trends in childhood overnutrition in LMICs are concerning, with overall prevalence approaching estimates of those reported in a few high-income nations. Geographic variability, gender disparity and association with maternal education emphasise the need for region-specific policies, focusing on community engagement and awareness towards rising overnutrition.",overweight obesity child grow global concern especially middle income country lmic consolidated evidence burden remain limited crucial target intervention review synthesise datum community base study estimate overall individual pool prevalence overweight obesity population explore factor associate pubme scopus embase search screen eligible study publish april individually researcher quality assessment eligible study conduct joanna briggs institute jbi tool datum prevalence overweight obesity associated factor include maternal education area residence maternal body weight household income breastfeed practice report include study extract random effect model meta analysis heterogeneity evaluate statistic source heterogeneity explore subgroup analysis compare effect size category geographic region overweight obesity measurement guideline sample size publication year meta regression assess relationship variable pooled estimate study screen eligible inclusion pooled prevalence overweight obesity child lmic confidence interval ci p value significant heterogeneity overnutrition prevalence increase year pooled prevalence overweight obesity vary significantly geography high prevalence african region low southeast asian region study report maternal education child mother secondary school education high increase odd have overweight obesity odd ratio ci prevalence estimate differ significantly gender boy girl ci individual study report significant association factor area residence maternal body weight income status breastfeed practice meta analysis perform heterogeneity trend childhood overnutrition lmic concern overall prevalence approach estimate report high income nation geographic variability gender disparity association maternal education emphasise need region specific policy focus community engagement awareness rise overnutrition
"Multifactorial Determinants of Pulsed Radiofrequency Treatment Outcomes in Meralgia Paresthetica: A Focus on Obesity, Comorbidities, and Technical Variables.","Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is the second most common nerve entrapment. This study aimed to investigate the impact of obesity, comorbidities, and technical variables on treatment outcomes following ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) neuromodulation of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) in MP over a 6-month period. In this retrospective cohort study, 30 MP patients who underwent PRF of the LFCN and were followed for at least 6 months were analyzed. Treatment response was defined as a Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) score <4 at 6 months. Obesity was classified as a body mass index (BMI) ≥30. Of the patients, 13 (43.3%) were classified as responders (Group 1), while 17 (56.7%) were nonresponders (Group 2). Correlation analysis revealed that female sex (r = 0.372, P = 0.043), BMI (r = 0.582, P = 0.001), waist circumference (r = 0.411, P = 0.024), hip circumference (r = 0.557, P = 0.001), fibromyalgia (r = 0.458, P = 0.011), depression (r = 0.449, P = 0.013), high triglyceride (r = 0.447, P = 0.021) and total cholesterol levels (r = 0.401, P = 0.028), low vitamin D levels (r = -0.419, P = 0.021), shorter PRF duration (r = -0.833, P = 0.001), and inadequate response to the diagnostic block (r = 0.682, P = 0.001) were significantly associated with higher DN4 scores at 6 months. Obesity was associated with decreased treatment success at 6 months post-PRF. Additionally, female sex, depression, fibromyalgia, vitamin D deficiency, and reduced cortical amplitude on the affected side negatively impacted outcomes. Longer PRF duration and greater response to the diagnostic block were linked to improved efficacy.",meralgia paresthetica mp second common nerve entrapment study aim investigate impact obesity comorbiditie technical variable treatment outcome follow ultrasound guide pulse radiofrequency prf neuromodulation lateral femoral cutaneous nerve lfcn mp month period retrospective cohort study mp patient undergo prf lfcn follow month analyze treatment response define douleur neuropathique score month obesity classify body mass index bmi patient classify responder group nonresponder group correlation analysis reveal female sex r p bmi r p waist circumference r p hip circumference r p fibromyalgia r p depression r p high triglyceride r p total cholesterol level r p low vitamin d level r p short prf duration r p inadequate response diagnostic block r p significantly associate high score month obesity associate decrease treatment success month post prf additionally female sex depression fibromyalgia vitamin d deficiency reduce cortical amplitude affected negatively impact outcome long prf duration great response diagnostic block link improved efficacy
Parent-focused behavioural interventions for the prevention of early childhood obesity (TOPCHILD): a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis.,"Childhood obesity is a global public health issue, which has prompted governments to invest in prevention programmes. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of parent-focused early childhood obesity prevention interventions globally. We did a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. We searched databases and trial registries (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycInfo, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) from inception until Sept 30, 2024, for randomised controlled trials commencing before 12 months of age examining parent-focused behavioural interventions to prevent obesity in children, compared with usual care, no intervention, or attention control. Individual participant data were checked, harmonised, and assessed for integrity and risk of bias. We excluded trials that were quasi-randomised, investigated pregnancy-only interventions, or did not collect any child weight-related outcomes. The primary outcome was BMI Z score at age 24 months (±6 months). We did an intention-to-treat, two-stage, random effects meta-analysis to examine effects overall and for prespecified subgroups. We assessed certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177408. Of 19 990 identified records, 47 (0·24%) trials were completed and eligible. Of these, 18 (38%) assessed our primary outcome, BMI Z score. We obtained individual participant data for 17 (94%; n=9128) of these 18 trials (n=9383), representing 97% of eligible participants. Of these 9128 participants, 4549 (50%) were boys, 4415 (48%) were girls, and 164 (2%) had unknown sex. We found no evidence of an effect of interventions on BMI Z score at age 24 months (±6 months; mean difference -0·01 [95% CI -0·08 to 0·05]; high certainty evidence, τ<sup>2</sup>=0·01; n=6505; 2623 missing). Findings were robust to prespecified sensitivity analyses (eg, different analysis methods and missing data), and we found no evidence of differential intervention effects for prespecified subgroups including priority populations and trial-level factors. These findings indicate that examined parent-focused behavioural interventions are insufficient to prevent obesity at age 24 months (±6 months). This evidence highlights a need to re-think childhood obesity prevention approaches.

Intentional Weight Loss and Associated Cancer Incidence Among People With Overweight or Obesity: A Systematic Literature Review.,"While obesity is linked to increased cancer risk, evidence on the impact of intentional weight loss on obesity-associated cancers (OACs) is limited. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to assess the association between intentional weight loss and cancer incidence, including overall cancers and 13 OACs, from recent observational studies and clinical trials. Studies published between January 2019 and May 2023 were searched within MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Studies assessing the relationship between intentional weight loss, defined as weight reduction via metabolic-bariatric surgery (MBS) or lifestyle interventions, and cancer incidence were included. A dual independent review process was used to screen 1954 abstracts and 84 full-text articles, and to extract data from 18 full studies. All discrepancies were resolved by another reviewer. Of the 18 studies included, 17 studies were observational, focusing on MBS as the method for achieving weight reduction. One randomised controlled trial examined the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention on weight reduction and found no significant association between intentional weight loss and cancer risk. Intentional weight loss was associated with decreased cancer incidence in 71.4% (n = 5/7) of studies for all cancers and 66.7% (n = 4/6) of studies for OACs, with reported risk reductions of 11% to 33% and 11% to 41%, respectively. For specific OACs, a greater number of studies indicated that weight reduction was associated with reduced occurrence of endometrial (4/4, 100%, 31%-53% risk reduction), female breast (5/9, 55.6%, 19%-50% risk reduction) and colorectal (4/7, 57.1%, 20%-60% risk reduction) cancers.

Systematic Literature Reviews on the Disease Burden of Pediatric Psoriasis.,"Pediatric psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that substantially impacts the quality of life (QoL) of affected children and their families. Despite numerous literature reviews on psoriasis, data on pediatric populations remain sparse. We aimed to systematically identify and synthesize evidence on the epidemiological, humanistic, and economic burden of pediatric psoriasis, focusing on moderate-to-severe cases. We conducted two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) of studies on pediatric psoriasis: one focusing on the epidemiological and disease burden of psoriasis of any severity, and one focusing on the humanistic and economic burden in moderate-to-severe psoriasis only. Data were collected from multiple databases, supplemented by additional sources. We identified 56 studies across two SLRs, including interventional studies and observational real-world data from diverse geographic regions. The findings are consistent with the characterization of pediatric psoriasis as a multisystem disease, with higher burden in more severe cases. Prevalence appears to increase with age, and key risk factors are commonly associated with obesity and asthma. Comorbidities span mental health (depression, anxiety), metabolic (obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), musculoskeletal (psoriatic arthritis), and gastrointestinal (celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) conditions. Disease severity correlates with higher rates of metabolic syndrome, poorer health-related QoL, and increased caregiver burden, including emotional distress and sleep disturbances. Economic data were limited, with no comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses or utility measures identified. Our findings indicate limited evidence on the full spectrum of the pediatric psoriasis burden, particularly in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Data are limited on the prevalence of moderate-to-severe cases, as well as healthcare resource utilization and economic impacts in this population, highlighting the need for further research to inform disease management and resource allocation. Emerging therapies may improve the lives of affected children and their caregivers, but further research is needed to fully capture their potential benefits.",pediatric psoriasis chronic inflammatory skin disease substantially impact quality life qol affected child family despite numerous literature review psoriasis datum pediatric population remain sparse aim systematically identify synthesize evidence epidemiological humanistic economic burden pediatric psoriasis focus moderate severe case conduct systematic literature review slrs study pediatric psoriasis focus epidemiological disease burden psoriasis severity focus humanistic economic burden moderate severe psoriasis datum collect multiple database supplement additional source identify study slrs include interventional study observational real world datum diverse geographic region finding consistent characterization pediatric psoriasis multisystem disease high burden severe case prevalence appear increase age key risk factor commonly associate obesity asthma comorbiditie span mental health depression anxiety metabolic obesity diabetes hyperlipidemia musculoskeletal psoriatic arthritis gastrointestinal celiac disease ulcerative colitis crohn disease condition disease severity correlate high rate metabolic syndrome poor health relate qol increase caregiver burden include emotional distress sleep disturbance economic datum limited comprehensive cost effectiveness analysis utility measure identify finding indicate limited evidence spectrum pediatric psoriasis burden particularly moderate severe psoriasis datum limit prevalence moderate severe case healthcare resource utilization economic impact population highlight need research inform disease management resource allocation emerge therapy improve life affected child caregiver research need fully capture potential benefit
Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Dental Procedures following Total Joint Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a serious complication following total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Hematogenous spread, including from dental procedures, is a proposed mechanism for PJI. While prophylactic antibiotics (PAs) have traditionally been recommended before dental procedures in patients with joint prostheses, recent guidelines question their effectiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the association between dental antibiotic prophylaxis and PJI risk through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies included adult patients who had TJAs undergoing dental procedures, with and without antibiotic prophylaxis, and reported PJI outcomes. There were four retrospective cohort studies, encompassing 157,466 patients, that met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects meta-analysis with Hartung-Knapp adjustment was used to pool odds ratios (OR). Incidence of PJI ranged from 0.07 to 0.3% across included studies. There were no studies that demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PJI rates among patients who received prophylactic antibiotics. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in PJI risk between antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups, with a slight, non-significant increase in risk among patients receiving antibiotics. Several studies identified other PJI risk factors, including revision arthroplasty, obesity, congestive heart failure, and diabetes with end-organ damage. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients who have primary total hip or knee arthroplasty does not reduce the risk of PJI. Given the low overall incidence of PJI and the potential harms of unnecessary antibiotic use, including resistance and adverse effects, current evidence supports limiting prophylaxis to select high-risk populations. Updated clinical guidelines should reflect these findings to enhance antibiotic stewardship and reduce healthcare costs.",periprosthetic joint infection pji complication follow total joint arthroplasty tja hematogenous spread include dental procedure propose mechanism pji prophylactic antibiotic pas traditionally recommend dental procedure patient joint prosthesis recent guideline question effectiveness study aim evaluate association dental antibiotic prophylaxis pji risk systematic review meta analysis systematic literature search conduct pubme embase cochrane database accordance preferred reporting item systematic review meta analysis guideline study include adult patient tjas undergo dental procedure antibiotic prophylaxis report pji outcome retrospective cohort study encompass patient meet inclusion criterion study quality assess newcastle ottawa scale random effect meta analysis hartung knapp adjustment pool odd ratio incidence pji range include study study demonstrate statistically significant reduction pji rate patient receive prophylactic antibiotic meta analysis show significant difference pji risk antibiotic non antibiotic group slight non significant increase risk patient receive antibiotic study identify pji risk factor include revision arthroplasty obesity congestive heart failure diabete end organ damage routine use prophylactic antibiotic dental procedure patient primary total hip knee arthroplasty reduce risk pji give low overall incidence pji potential harm unnecessary antibiotic use include resistance adverse effect current evidence support limit prophylaxis select high risk population update clinical guideline reflect finding enhance antibiotic stewardship reduce healthcare cost
Global challenges in diabetes research and care: which way forward? An appraisal from the EASD Global Council.,"This review article, developed by the EASD Global Council, addresses the growing global challenges in diabetes research and care, highlighting the rising prevalence of diabetes, the increasing complexity of its management and the need for a coordinated international response. With regard to research, disparities in funding and infrastructure between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are discussed. The under-representation of LMIC populations in clinical trials, challenges in conducting large-scale research projects, and the ethical and legal complexities of artificial intelligence integration are also considered as specific issues. The development of global research networks and strategies for improved training, standardisation of data and enhanced accessibility to big data analytics to drive innovation and personalised medicine are recommended. With regard to diabetes care, inequalities in access to essential medications, particularly insulin and novel therapies, and disparities in healthcare infrastructure are discussed. Proposed initiatives include international support programmes, improved healthcare provider training and the inclusion of newer diabetes medications in essential drug lists. The importance of global screening programmes, a universal diabetes education curriculum and standardised healthcare checklists is also emphasised. Regarding healthcare organisation, the development of national diabetes registers, benchmarking performance across regions and strengthening international collaborations are highly advised. The role of diabetes specialists as care coordinators and the need for structured assessments to improve early intervention and long-term outcomes are also discussed. Ultimately, the EASD Global Council urges action for a unified, global approach to diabetes research and care to bridge the gap between scientific innovation and clinical practice, ensuring equitable healthcare worldwide.",review article develop easd global council address grow global challenge diabetes research care highlight rise prevalence diabetes increase complexity management need coordinated international response regard research disparity funding infrastructure high income country middle income country lmic discuss representation lmic population clinical trial challenge conduct large scale research project ethical legal complexity artificial intelligence integration consider specific issue development global research network strategy improved training standardisation datum enhance accessibility big data analytic drive innovation personalised medicine recommend regard diabetes care inequality access essential medication particularly insulin novel therapy disparity healthcare infrastructure discuss propose initiative include international support programme improve healthcare provider training inclusion new diabetes medication essential drug list importance global screening programme universal diabetes education curriculum standardised healthcare checklist emphasise healthcare organisation development national diabetes register benchmarke performance region strengthen international collaboration highly advised role diabetes specialist care coordinator need structured assessment improve early intervention long term outcome discuss ultimately easd global council urge action unify global approach diabetes research care bridge gap scientific innovation clinical practice ensure equitable healthcare worldwide
Effectiveness and Safety of Insulin Glargine 300 U/ml in High-Risk Subgroups (Renal Impairment and Older Age ≥ 70 years) of Insulin-Naïve People with Type 2 Diabetes: A Post hoc Analysis of Real-World ATOS Study.,"This post hoc analysis of an A Toujeo<sup>®</sup> Observational Study (ATOS) aims to evaluate the real-world effectiveness and safety of insulin glargine 300 U/ml (Gla-300) in high-risk subgroups of insulin-naïve people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D) from multiple geographical regions (Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe). In these post hoc analyses of ATOS, a real-world, 12-month, prospective study included 4422 insulin-naïve adults (age ≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled (HbA<sub>1c</sub> > 7% and ≤ 11%) on one or more oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) who initiated Gla-300 treatment as per routine practice. Primary and secondary endpoints were studied according to renal impairment (RI) status (without or with) and age group (</≥ 70 years). At baseline, participants with a history of RI (N = 581, 13.1%) and older participants (aged ≥ 70 years, N = 514, 11.6%) had a longer duration of diabetes and were more likely to present diabetic complications compared to without RI and younger participants (aged < 70 years). At month 6, the individualized HbA<sub>1c</sub> target (as determined by their treating physician) was achieved in 27.5% of participants with RI compared to 24.8% of participants without RI whereas 32.3% of older participants achieved their individualized HbA<sub>1c</sub> target compared to 24.2% of younger participants. In this post hoc analysis, Gla-300 treatment improved glycemic control with meaningful reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and fasting self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) across all subgroups. The incidence of hypoglycemia was low and changes in body weight were minimal across all subgroups. In a real-world setting, the initiation of Gla-300 in insulin-naïve PwT2D uncontrolled on OADs resulted in improved glycemic control with a low incidence of hypoglycemia and minimal weight change in participants with a history of RI and in older participants.

Impact of Metabolically Healthy and Unhealthy Obesity on Outcomes of Sepsis Complicated by Septic Shock in Elderly Patients.,"Obesity is a risk factor for sepsis complications in older adults. We assessed the impact of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUHO) on outcomes in septic shock. We conducted a retrospective analysis using the National Inpatient Sample (2016-2020) to identify a cohort of 1,737,075 patients aged 65 years and older who were hospitalized with septic shock, as defined by ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Obese patients without hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia were classified as MHO; those with ≥1 risk factor as MUHO. Baseline demographics and hospital characteristics were compared using χ² and Mann-Whitney U tests. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbidity index, and hospital factors estimated odds ratios (ORs) for respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality, and cardiac arrest. Secondary endpoints included length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization cost. Among 268 050 obese patients, 23 915 (1.4%) were classified as MHO and 244 135 (14.1%) as MUHO. Both phenotypes were more prevalent in females and least common among Asian patients. MHO prevalence was highest among Native Americans, while MUHO was most common among Hispanics in 2020. From 2016 to 2019, the prevalence of both phenotypes remained stable, with modest increases observed during the 2020 sepsis surge. Respiratory failure occurred most frequently in the MHO group (∼70%), followed by MUHO (∼65%) and non-obese patients (∼60%). After adjusting for confounders, both MHO and MUHO groups had higher odds of respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation compared to non-obese patients. In-hospital mortality increased across all groups in 2020; however, MUHO patients had lower adjusted mortality risk. Cardiac arrest rates remained unchanged, while length of stay and hospitalization costs were highest among MHO patients. MHO and MUHO both confer higher respiratory failure and ventilation risk; lower mortality in MUHO warrants further study.Clinical ImplicationsPhenotypic obesity classification may improve sepsis risk stratification and inform metabolic-specific management.",obesity risk factor sepsis complication old adult assess impact metabolically healthy obesity mho metabolically unhealthy obesity muho outcome septic shock conduct retrospective analysis national inpatient sample identify cohort patient age year old hospitalize septic shock define diagnosis code obese patient hypertension diabetes hyperlipidemia classify mho risk factor muho baseline demographics hospital characteristic compare mann whitney u test multivariable logistic regression adjust age sex race comorbidity index hospital factor estimate odd ratio or respiratory failure mechanical ventilation hospital mortality cardiac arrest secondary endpoint include length stay los hospitalization cost obese patient classify mho muho phenotype prevalent female common asian patient mho prevalence high native americans muho common hispanic prevalence phenotype remain stable modest increase observe sepsis surge respiratory failure occur frequently mho group follow muho non obese patient adjust confounder mho muho group high odd respiratory failure mechanical ventilation compare non obese patient hospital mortality increase group muho patient low adjust mortality risk cardiac arrest rate remain unchanged length stay hospitalization cost high mho patient mho muho confer high respiratory failure ventilation risk low mortality muho warrant implicationsphenotypic obesity classification improve sepsis risk stratification inform metabolic specific management
The Silent Surge: Obesity Driving a Global Cardiovascular Crisis.,"Recent global estimates indicate that more than one billion people live with obesity, a figure that has doubled since 1990. When overweight individuals are included, nearly 2.5 billion adults are affected, with high body mass index contributing to an estimated 1.9 million cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths annually. Obesity and its close association with CVD remain pressing public health challenges that require sustained, coordinated action. Recent global policy discussions, including the UN General Assembly's Zero Draft Political Declaration, highlight the importance of improving food labelling, taxing sugary drinks, limiting the marketing of unhealthy foods, and encouraging active living through supportive urban planning. Countries are encouraged to align national obesity strategies with the WHO's 2022 Acceleration Plan to STOP Obesity, with clear goals and mechanisms for accountability and monitoring. Preventive measures are most effective when introduced early, such as encouraging breastfeeding and creating supportive school environments that offer balanced meals, limit access to unhealthy foods, and incorporate regular physical activity into daily schedules. Fiscal measures, including taxes, subsidies, and mandatory nutrition labels, can help guide consumer choices towards healthier options. Supportive built environments with safe access to parks, pedestrian routes, and cycling paths further encourage active lifestyles. Health systems are central in ensuring equitable access to prevention and treatment, delivered through stigma-free and evidence-based care. Community-based and family-oriented programs have shown promise, while pharmacological options may complement lifestyle approaches where appropriate. Long-term progress depends on sustained commitment, cross-sectoral collaboration, and integration of obesity prevention into broader public health frameworks.",recent global estimate indicate billion people live obesity figure double overweight individual include nearly billion adult affect high body mass index contribute estimate million cardiovascular disease cvd death annually obesity close association cvd remain press public health challenge require sustain coordinated action recent global policy discussion include un general assembly zero draft political declaration highlight importance improve food labelling tax sugary drink limit marketing unhealthy food encourage active living supportive urban planning country encourage align national obesity strategy acceleration plan stop obesity clear goal mechanism accountability monitoring preventive measure effective introduce early encourage breastfeed create supportive school environment offer balanced meal limit access unhealthy food incorporate regular physical activity daily schedule fiscal measure include taxis subsidy mandatory nutrition label help guide consumer choice healthy option supportive build environment safe access park pedestrian route cycling path encourage active lifestyle health system central ensure equitable access prevention treatment deliver stigma free evidence base care community base family orient program show promise pharmacological option complement lifestyle approach appropriate long term progress depend sustained commitment cross sectoral collaboration integration obesity prevention broad public health framework
A potential association between tirzepatide and hypercalcemia in the setting of chronic hydrochlorothiazide use.,"Hypercalcemia is a prevalent electrolyte disturbance commonly associated with primary hyperparathyroidism, cancer, or medication adverse effects. Thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium excretion, increasing calcium reabsorption and hypercalcemia. Tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, is increasingly used for type 2 diabetes and obesity. While GIP/GLP-1 agonists typically have negligible effects on calcium homeostasis, the interaction between tirzepatide and thiazides remains unstudied. We report a 65-year-old female with obesity, hypertension, CKD3, and T2DM on chronic HCTZ who developed symptomatic hypercalcemia (corrected calcium: 4.58 mmol/L; normal range: 2.12-2.62 mmol/L), resulting in altered mental status days after initiating tirzepatide. PTH and vitamin D levels were low, and imaging ruled out malignancy. Discontinuation of tirzepatide/HCTZ, IV hydration, and calcitonin normalized her calcium by hospital day 4. This case highlights a potential association between HCTZ and tirzepatide in causing severe hypercalcemia. No prior reports link tirzepatide (or its combination with thiazides) to hypercalcemia. The mechanism likely involves thiazide-induced calcium reabsorption and tirzepatide's effects on bone turnover. As the use of tirzepatide and other GLP-1/GIP agonists becomes more prevalent, clinicians need to closely monitor calcium levels in thiazide-treated individuals, particularly those with CKD. Additional research is also needed to elucidate the drug's interaction with calcium metabolism. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for severe hypercalcemia when tirzepatide is co-administered with chronic thiazide diuretics, particularly hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), in patients with pre-existing CKD. Tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, may influence calcium metabolism through mechanisms including increased osteoblastic activity and altered PTH regulation, especially in individuals with impaired renal clearance. Baseline and follow-up serum calcium monitoring is strongly recommended within 1-2 weeks of initiating tirzepatide in patients receiving thiazide diuretics or those with CKD. This case suggests a possible drug-drug interaction between tirzepatide and HCTZ leading to symptomatic hypercalcemia, highlighting the need for pharmacovigilance as newer agents are integrated into routine diabetes care. Severe hypercalcemia can present with nonspecific symptoms such as altered mental status, fatigue, constipation, and polyuria; clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in susceptible populations.

Does Bariatric Surgery Impact Hypothyroidism and Vice Versa? Results of a Prospective Comparative Study.,"The imbalanced basal metabolic rate and energy expenditure proportion is an essential etiology of obesity. Thyroid hormones are vital in managing energy expenditure and body mass index (BMI). Hypothyroidism is associated with a decreased metabolic rate and increased prevalence of obesity. We aimed to analyze the outcomes of bariatric surgery among patients who underwent bariatric surgery with hypothyroidism and morbid obesity. We performed a prospective comparative analysis of 314 patients who underwent bariatric surgery between September 2019 and November 2022 and completed 1-year follow-up. Patients were divided into control and test groups, comprising 158 euthyroid and 156 hypothyroid patients living with obesity, respectively. Among 156 hypothyroid patients,131 (83.9%) were females. The mean BMI was 44.82 ± 9.46 kg/m2. Percentage total weight loss (%TWL) during 6 months and 1 year was 25.46 ± 4.59 and 36.61 ± 5.13 (p < 0.001), respectively. The baseline value of TSH, FT3, and FT4 was 7.78 ± 11.11, 3.07 ± 0.46, and 1.29 ± 0.27, respectively. Serum TSH significantly reduced at 6 months (3.82 ± 2.15) (p- 0.040) and 1 year (2.61 ± 1.62) (p-0.018), while changes in FT3 and FT4 were not significant. There was a negative correlation of TSH (r - 0.395*, p 0.031) and FT3(r - 0.357*, p = 0.049) with %TWL at 1 year. Thyroid replacement therapy (TRT) dosage significantly reduced 1 year following surgery (p < 0.001). TSH and FT3 are directly associated with TRT improvement. Bariatric surgery promotes significant improvement in thyroid function and a decrease in TRT dosage. A negative correlation was observed between %TWL, FT3, and TSH reduction. A reduction in FT3 and TSH directly correlates with decreased TRT dosage.",imbalance basal metabolic rate energy expenditure proportion essential etiology obesity thyroid hormone vital manage energy expenditure body mass index bmi hypothyroidism associate decrease metabolic rate increase prevalence obesity aim analyze outcome bariatric surgery patient undergo bariatric surgery hypothyroidism morbid obesity perform prospective comparative analysis patient undergo bariatric surgery september november complete year follow patient divide control test group comprise euthyroid hypothyroid patient live obesity respectively hypothyroid female mean bmi kg percentage total weight loss twl month year p respectively baseline value tsh respectively serum tsh significantly reduce month year change significant negative correlation tsh r p p twl year thyroid replacement therapy trt dosage significantly reduce year follow surgery p tsh directly associate trt improvement bariatric surgery promote significant improvement thyroid function decrease trt dosage negative correlation observe twl tsh reduction reduction tsh directly correlate decrease trt dosage
"Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD): the interplay of gut microbiome, insulin resistance, and diabetes.","The global prevalence of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) has reached alarming levels, affecting nearly one-third of the world's population. This review analyzes current evidence on the intricate relationships between MASLD, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with particular emphasis on gut microbiome interactions. As MASLD progresses from simple steatosis to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), it can lead to severe complications including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of MASLD is multifactorial, involving hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysregulation of the gut-liver axis. Insulin resistance is a central driver of disease progression, closely linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent research highlights how gut microbiome dysbiosis exacerbates MASLD through mechanisms such as increased intestinal permeability, systemic inflammation, and altered metabolic signaling. Identification of microbial signatures offers promise for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. By integrating metabolic, inflammatory, and microbial perspectives, this review provides a comprehensive overview of MASLD pathogenesis and its association with obesity, insulin resistance, and T2DM.",global prevalence metabolic dysfunction associate steatotic liver disease masld reach alarming level affect nearly world population review analyze current evidence intricate relationship masld insulin resistance type diabetes mellitus dm particular emphasis gut microbiome interaction masld progress simple steatosis metabolic dysfunction associate steatohepatitis mash lead severe complication include fibrosis cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis masld multifactorial involve hepatic lipid accumulation oxidative stress inflammation dysregulation gut liver axis insulin resistance central driver disease progression closely link obesity metabolic syndrome recent research highlight gut microbiome dysbiosis exacerbate masld mechanism increase intestinal permeability systemic inflammation alter metabolic signal identification microbial signature offer promise novel diagnostic therapeutic strategy integrate metabolic inflammatory microbial perspective review provide comprehensive overview masld pathogenesis association obesity insulin resistance dm
Sex Differences in Effectiveness of Semaglutide in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease: The STRIDE Trial.,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is prevalent in women and men with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Sex-based differences exist in its epidemiology, clinical presentation, functional impact, outcomes, and potentially in responses to treatments. Recently, semaglutide 1.0 mg has been shown to improve functional outcomes and health-related quality of life (QoL) in individuals with early symptomatic PAD and T2D in the STRIDE trial. To describe baseline characteristics, functional status, and therapeutic efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg between females and males with PAD and T2D as a post-hoc analysis from the STRIDE trial. The primary endpoint in STRIDE was the ratio to baseline in maximum walking distance (MWD) at week 52 on a constant load treadmill. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included change in MWD at week 57, change in pain-free walking distance (PFWD) at week 52, and change in PAD-specific vascular quality of life (VascuQoL-6) total score from baseline to week 52. Herein, we report the outcomes analyzed by sex. Of 792 participants, 195 (24.6%) were female and 597 (75.4%) were male. Females were younger, had lower rates of smoking, lower prevalence of concomitant coronary artery disease and heart failure, and less frequent use of antiplatelet therapies compared to males. Geometric mean MWD at baseline was 187.3 meters (coefficient of variation [CV] 0.6) and 191.5 meters (CV 0.6) in females and males, respectively. At week 52, there was a consistent improvement in MWD across sexes, which favored semaglutide treatment (p-interaction value=0.65). At week 57, there was a consistent trend for improved MWD that favored semaglutide treatment for both females and males (p-interaction value=0.53). Improvement in PFWD was consistent across sexes at week 52 in favor of semaglutide (p-interaction value=0.80). Likewise, PAD-specific QoL (assessed by VascuQOL-6) improvements with semaglutide in both sexes were consistent with the overall trial. In this post-hoc analysis from STRIDE, semaglutide 1.0 mg exhibited consistent improvements in functional outcomes in people with early symptomatic PAD and T2D regardless of sex. Females with PAD demonstrated differences in baseline demographics, and treatment patterns compared to males, highlighting the importance of sex-specific evaluation in PAD trials.",peripheral artery disease pad prevalent woman man type diabetes sex base difference exist epidemiology clinical presentation functional impact outcome potentially response treatment recently semaglutide mg show improve functional outcome health relate quality life qol individual early symptomatic pad stride trial describe baseline characteristic functional status therapeutic efficacy weekly semaglutide mg female male pad post hoc analysis stride trial primary endpoint stride ratio baseline maximum walking distance mwd week constant load treadmill confirmatory secondary endpoint include change mwd week change pain free walking distance pfwd week change pad specific vascular quality life total score baseline week report outcome analyze sex participant female male female young low rate smoking low prevalence concomitant coronary artery disease heart failure frequent use antiplatelet therapy compare male geometric mean mwd baseline meter coefficient variation cv meter cv female male respectively week consistent improvement mwd sex favor semaglutide treatment p interaction week consistent trend improved mwd favor semaglutide treatment female male p interaction improvement pfwd consistent sex week favor semaglutide p interaction likewise pad specific qol assess improvement semaglutide sex consistent overall trial post hoc analysis stride semaglutide mg exhibit consistent improvement functional outcome people early symptomatic pad regardless sex female pad demonstrate difference baseline demographic treatment pattern compare male highlight importance sex specific evaluation pad trial
Integrative proteomic analysis provides novel therapeutic insights for etiological subtypes of diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a highly heterogeneous disease characterised by subtypes with variations in aetiology, disease progression, and risk of complications. However, potential drug targets for these subtypes have not been explored. This study aims to investigate potential drug targets by integrating proteomics. Summary-level data of circulating proteins were extracted from the UK Biobank and the deCODE Health Study. Genetic associations with five diabetes subtypes were obtained from Swedish All New Diabetics in Scania and Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort, including severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID), severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), and mild age-related diabetes (MARD). The associations between circulating proteins and diabetes subtypes were assessed through Mendelian randomisation, followed by multiple sensitivity and colocalization analyses. Additionally, tissue-specific, pathway and functional enrichment analysis, assessment of protein druggability, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were used to further explore biological mechanisms and therapeutic potential. Genetically predicted levels of 2, 2, 9, 3, and 5 circulating proteins were associated with SIRD, SIDD, MARD, MOD, and SAID, respectively. Colocalization analyses further revealed links between GRN with MARD/SIRD, LILRB5 with SIDD/MARD, CR1 with MARD, TNFSF12 with MOD, and DAPK2 with SAID. Enrichment analysis suggested that these proteins were mainly enriched in blood and adipose tissues and involved in immune and inflammatory related pathways. PPI analysis revealed GRN, TNFSF12, and DAPK2 are associated with known T2D targets. Our study identified several potential drug targets for different subtypes of diabetes using an integrated genetic approach, yielding new insights for precision medicine of diabetes.",type diabetes highly heterogeneous disease characterise subtype variation aetiology disease progression risk complication potential drug target subtype explore study aim investigate potential drug target integrate proteomic summary level datum circulate protein extract uk biobank decode health study genetic association diabetes subtype obtain swedish new diabetic scania malmö diet cancer cohort include severe autoimmune diabetes say severe insulin deficient diabetes sidd severe insulin resistant diabetes sird mild obesity relate diabetes mod mild age relate diabetes mard association circulate protein diabete subtype assess mendelian randomisation follow multiple sensitivity colocalization analysis additionally tissue specific pathway functional enrichment analysis assessment protein druggability protein protein interaction ppi network explore biological mechanism therapeutic potential genetically predict level circulate protein associate sird sidd mard mod say respectively colocalization analysis reveal link grn mard sird sidd mard mard mod say enrichment analysis suggest protein mainly enrich blood adipose tissue involve immune inflammatory relate pathway ppi analysis reveal grn associate know target study identify potential drug target different subtype diabete integrate genetic approach yield new insight precision medicine diabetes
"Income-based inequalities in risk factors of NCDs and inequities of preventive care services amongst 202,682 adults: a cross-sectional study of South Asia Biobank.","There is scant research examining income-based inequalities in risk factors of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and inequities of preventive care services across the South Asian population. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 202,682 adults aged 18 or above in four South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. We combined South Asia Biobank (SAB) surveillance data with environmental mapping exposure and 24-h dietary recall to estimate income-based inequalities using concentration curves and concentration indices (CI) that measure the magnitude and directional inequality effects. We also computed the horizontal inequity index (HII) for need-standardised healthcare utilisation and advice by measuring the extent to which the distribution of health promotion advice matches the distribution of diet-related risk factor variables across the income distribution. We reported concentration index coefficients and standard errors. Inequalities in exposure and diet-related risk factors of NCDs were observed. Underweight was concentrated amongst the poor (CI = - 0.16, SE = 0.005, p < 0.001), while overweight and obesity were concentrated amongst the rich (CI = 0.11, SE = 0.003, p < 0.001). Non-recommended intake of fats (CI = 0.04, SE = 0.003, p < 0.001) and carbohydrates were concentrated amongst the rich (CI = 0.05, SE = 0.003, p < 0.001), while non-recommended intake of free sugars (CI = - 0.05, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001) and fruits and vegetables amongst the poor (CI = - 0.07, SE = 0.005, p < 0.001). Exposure to unhealthy outlets was concentrated amongst the rich (CI = 0.02, SE = 0.002, p < 0.001). There were persistent and pro-rich inequities in healthcare utilisation (HII = 0.02, SE = 0.002, p < 0.001) and advice for salt reduction (HII = 0.02, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001), fat reduction (HII = 0.02, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001), healthy weight (HII = 0.03, SE = 0.006, p < 0.001), and fruits and vegetables consumption (HII = 0.04, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001).

"Influence of Exercise on Oxygen Consumption, Pulmonary Ventilation, and Blood Gas Analyses in Individuals with Chronic Diseases.","The increasing prevalence of chronic metabolic diseases poses a significant challenge in the modern world, impacting healthcare systems and individual life expectancy. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that older adults (65+ years) engage in 150-300 min of moderate-intensity or 75-150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, alongside muscle-strengthening and balance-training exercises at least twice a week. However, nearly one-third of the adult population (31%) is physically inactive, which increases the risk of developing obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and psychological issues. Physical activity in the form of aerobic exercise, resistance training, or a combination of both is effective in preventing and managing these metabolic diseases. In this review, we explored the effects of exercise training, especially on respiratory and pulmonary factors, including oxygen consumption, pulmonary ventilation, and blood gas analyses among adults. During exercise, oxygen consumption can increase up to 15-fold (from a resting rate of ~250 mL/min) to meet heightened metabolic demands, enhancing tidal volume and pulmonary efficiency. During exercise, the increased energy demand of skeletal muscle leads to increases in tidal volume and pulmonary function, while blood gases play a key role in maintaining the pH of the blood. In this review, we explored the influence of age, body composition (BMI and obesity), lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol use), and comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, neurodegenerative disorders) in the modulation of these physiological responses. We underscored exercise as a potent non-pharmacological intervention for improving cardiopulmonary health and mitigating the progression of metabolic diseases in aging populations.",increase prevalence chronic metabolic disease pose significant challenge modern world impact healthcare system individual life expectancy world health organization recommend old adult year engage min moderate intensity min vigorous intensity physical activity alongside muscle strengthening balance training exercise twice week nearly adult population physically inactive increase risk develop obesity type diabetes cardiovascular disease hypertension psychological issue physical activity form aerobic exercise resistance training combination effective prevent manage metabolic disease review explore effect exercise training especially respiratory pulmonary factor include oxygen consumption pulmonary ventilation blood gas analysis adult exercise oxygen consumption increase fold resting rate ml min meet heighten metabolic demand enhance tidal volume pulmonary efficiency exercise increase energy demand skeletal muscle lead increase tidal volume pulmonary function blood gas play key role maintain ph blood review explore influence age body composition bmi obesity lifestyle factor smoking alcohol use comorbiditie diabete hypertension neurodegenerative disorder modulation physiological response underscore exercise potent non pharmacological intervention improve cardiopulmonary health mitigate progression metabolic disease age population
"Trends in body mass index, nutrient intake and nutritional status of rural adults in India: National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau survey findings (1975-2012).","Overweight/obesity has increased to an epidemic proportion throughout the globe and is an important risk factor for many non-communicable diseases. Globally, 2.5 billion people were overweight/obese and 890 million were obese in 2022. A community based cross-sectional surveys carried out in 10 Indian states by National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau during 1975-79, 1996-97, and 2010-12 was used. In each state, 120 villages and 20 households per village were covered. A total 49,064, 30,740, and 56,235 subjects aged ≥ 18 years were covered and information on the household's socio-demographic characteristics and height (cm) and weight (kg) measurements were carried out. Associations between overweight/obesity and socio-demographic variables were tested using Pearson's chi-square test. The mean body mass index (BMI) has increased significantly (p < 0.001) from 18.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 18.3-18.4) in 1975-79 to 20.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 20.1-20.2) in 2010-12 among men and from 18.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 18.66-18.73) to 20.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 20.46-20.54) among women.

Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Managing Metabolic Syndrome: A Narrative Review.,"Metabolic syndrome, a cluster of interconnected metabolic risk factors such as central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, significantly increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite its rising prevalence and serious health consequences, metabolic syndrome remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, initially developed for T2DM management, have demonstrated promising therapeutic potential for addressing multiple components of metabolic syndrome. These drugs lower blood glucose levels by promoting glycosuria and exhibit additional benefits, including weight loss, reduced blood pressure, improved lipid profiles, and cardioprotective effects. The impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the five metabolic syndrome criteria listed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III)-central obesity, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose levels-is evaluated in this narrative review, which combines results from metaanalyses and clinical trials. Reduced waist circumference, better lipid profiles, lower blood pressure, and improved glycaemic management are some of the main outcomes. Diuresis, natriuresis, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation are the processes that underlie these effects. Although SGLT-2 inhibitors have a good safety record, they can cause uncommon diabetic ketoacidosis and urinary tract infections, which can be avoided with careful management. The study highlights that more research is necessary to understand long-term effects, optimize dosing regimens, and assess real-world applicability. According to these findings, SGLT-2 inhibitors are essential therapies for managing metabolic syndrome holistically, and they hold great promise for lowering the disease's worldwide burden and related health hazards.",metabolic syndrome cluster interconnect metabolic risk factor central obesity insulin resistance hypertension dyslipidemia significantly increase risk type diabetes mellitus dm cardiovascular disease cvd despite rise prevalence health consequence metabolic syndrome remain underdiagnosed undertreated sodium glucose co inhibitor initially develop dm management demonstrate promise therapeutic potential address multiple component metabolic syndrome drug lower blood glucose level promote glycosuria exhibit additional benefit include weight loss reduce blood pressure improve lipid profile cardioprotective effect impact inhibitor metabolic syndrome criterion list national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel iii ncep atp obesity triglyceride hdl cholesterol blood pressure fast glucose level evaluate narrative review combine result metaanalyse clinical trial reduce waist circumference well lipid profile low blood pressure improve glycaemic management main outcome diuresis natriuresis enhanced insulin sensitivity amp activate protein kinase ampk activation process underlie effect inhibitor good safety record cause uncommon diabetic ketoacidosis urinary tract infection avoid careful management study highlight research necessary understand long term effect optimize dosing regimen assess real world applicability accord finding inhibitor essential therapy manage metabolic syndrome holistically hold great promise lower disease worldwide burden related health hazard
"Cohort profile of the ICMR-Stillbirth Pooled India Cohort (ICMR-SPIC): estimating prevalence, analysing risk factors and developing prediction models for stillbirths in India.","Stillbirth is a significant public health problem in India, yet comprehensive epidemiological data on its prevalence and risk factors are lacking. The objectives of this research were to develop a dataset pooled from 10 well-characterised pregnancy cohorts across urban and rural India to estimate the prevalence of stillbirths, identify and quantify risk factors and develop a predictive risk stratification model for evidence-based clinical decision-making in high-risk pregnancies. Pregnant women were enrolled during the antenatal period in 10 existing cohorts across India. Enrolment occurred through either health facilities or community settings at four urban, four rural and two mixed urban-rural sites spanning nine states. All participants were enrolled before childbirth, with follow-up completed at least until delivery. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) stillbirth pooled India cohort (ICMR-Stillbirth Pooled India Cohort Dataset (SPIC)) comprises 229 695 pregnant women. The mean (SD) maternal age at recruitment was 24.8 (4.5) years. 22.2% were underweight (body mass index (BMI)<18.5 kg/m²) and 16.6% were overweight or obese (BMI≥23 kg/m²). Short stature (<145 cm) was observed in 6.9% of participants. The mean (SD) gestational age at birth was 38.4 (2.1) weeks. One-third of the participants (33.3%) experienced moderate-to-severe anaemia during pregnancy (haemoglobin<95 g/L), 52.8% were multiparous and 27.6% conceived within 18 months of their previous childbirth. Core maternal risk factors such as short stature, BMI, parity, prior stillbirths and anaemia during pregnancy were recorded in all cohorts. Additional variables, including gestational weight gain, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, antepartum haemorrhage and fetal distress, were available for over 80% of the cohorts, ensuring robust data coverage for risk factor analysis and modelling. ICMR-SPIC will be used to conduct individual-level pooled data analyses to estimate prevalence, identify key risk factors and develop predictive models for stillbirths. Findings will inform policies, clinical guidelines and targeted interventions for high-risk pregnancies.

Exposure to chlorpyrifos pesticide at a realistic dose modulates gut microbiome and induces non-obese associated diabetes.,"During the last decade, there has been a significant rise in the incidence of diabetes particularly, in Asian and African countries. Although obesity is an established risk factor for diabetes, more than 50% of diabetes patients in Asian and African countries are non-obese, which is in contrast to the Western population. The pathophysiology of non-obese diabetes remains largely unexplored, and recent studies have highlighted the possible role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and gut microbiota in the prevalence of non-obese type 2 diabetes. Among the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, chlorpyrifos, a widely used organophosphate insecticide, has been associated with the prevalence of non-obese associated type 2 diabetes. However, experiments on animal models have shown that CPF-induces obesity and lipogenesis, contributing to insulin resistance. Notably, all these animal experiments were conducted at doses not equivalent to human exposure levels. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of chronic exposure of CPF at a realistic dose in mice. C57/Bl6 mice were treated with CPF at 0.02 mg/kg body weight daily, which is equivalent to the daily exposure of humans based on theoretical maximum daily intake. After 120 days of treatment, the chlorpyrifos-treated group showed a significant increase in fasting blood glucose levels with no changes in body weight in comparison with untreated controls. 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolomics analyses revealed the role of gut microbiota in chlorpyrifos-induced hyperglycemia in mice. CPF disrupted gut microbial balance, with depletion of beneficial taxa (Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, Blautia, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibaculum) and enrichment of pathobionts (Oscillospiraceae_uncultured, Helicobacter, Colidextrobacter, Desulfovibrioceae_uncultured and Alistipes). Overall, this is the first animal study demonstrating the impact of exposure to chlorpyrifos at a realistic dose equivalent to human exposure that correlates with the observations from the human epidemiological studies.",decade significant rise incidence diabete particularly asian african country obesity establish risk factor diabetes diabetes patient asian african country non obese contrast western population pathophysiology non obese diabetes remain largely unexplored recent study highlight possible role endocrine disrupt chemical gut microbiota prevalence non obese type diabetes endocrine disrupt chemical chlorpyrifos widely organophosphate insecticide associate prevalence non obese associate type diabetes experiment animal model show cpf induce obesity lipogenesis contribute insulin resistance notably animal experiment conduct dose equivalent human exposure level study aim investigate impact chronic exposure cpf realistic dose mouse mouse treat cpf mg kg body weight daily equivalent daily exposure human base theoretical maximum daily intake day treatment chlorpyrifos treat group show significant increase fast blood glucose level change body weight comparison untreated control rdna sequence metabolomic analysis reveal role gut microbiota chlorpyrifos induce hyperglycemia mouse cpf disrupt gut microbial balance depletion beneficial taxa lactobacillus akkermansia blautia bifidobacterium faecalibaculum enrichment pathobiont helicobacter colidextrobacter alistipe overall animal study demonstrate impact exposure chlorpyrifos realistic dose equivalent human exposure correlate observation human epidemiological study
Rural-urban differences in lipid abnormalities among middle-aged and older Indians.,"Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The prevalence of dyslipidemia varies by geographic location, often higher in urban populations. Our study aimed to assess the prevalence of dyslipidemia in the aging Indian population and compare the rural-urban differences in lipid abnormalities. We analyzed baseline cross-sectional data from two longitudinal aging cohorts in rural and urban southern India- 2,797 participants from the rural (CBR-SANSCOG) cohort in Srinivaspura, Karnataka, and, 430 participants from the urban (CBR-TLSA) cohort in Bangalore, Karnataka. Participants aged ≥ 45 years were included, and those with dementia, severe psychiatric/medical illnesses, and severe visual/hearing impairments were excluded. Data on sociodemographic variables, physical activity, tobacco/alcohol use, BMI, diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, and other medical comorbidities were collected. Lipid profiles were measured from fasting peripheral venous blood samples using standard laboratory techniques and lipid abnormalities were classified based on the NCEP ATP-III criteria. Proportions of lipid abnormalities were compared between the two populations using the two-proportions Z-test, and risk factors associated with dyslipidemia were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. The prevalence of high total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) was significantly greater in the urban than rural population (TC: 37.0% vs. 28.4% p < 0.001 and LDL-c: 33.5% vs. 26.8%, p < 0.01, respectively), while the prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c: 72.4% vs. 44.2%, p <0.001), high triglycerides (TG: 45.7% vs. 38.6%, p <0.01) and lipid risk ratios (TC/HDL-c, TG/HDL-c and LDL-c/HDL-c) was higher in the rural than urban population. Females in both urban and rural populations were at a higher risk of having multiple lipid abnormalities. For the other risk factors assessed, while diabetes, overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity were associated with increased risks for certain lipid abnormalities, these associations were less pronounced in the urban population. Aging Indians, both in rural and urban settings, have an alarmingly high prevalence of lipid abnormalities. Considering an elevated cardiovascular disease risk associated with lipid abnormalities, targeted interventions towards these communities are necessary to reduce the disease burden.",dyslipidemia major risk factor cardiovascular disease cvd prevalence dyslipidemia varie geographic location high urban population study aim assess prevalence dyslipidemia age indian population compare rural urban difference lipid abnormality analyze baseline cross sectional datum longitudinal age cohort rural urban southern participant rural cbr sanscog cohort srinivaspura karnataka participant urban cbr tlsa cohort bangalore karnataka participant age year include dementia severe psychiatric medical illness severe visual hearing impairment exclude datum sociodemographic variable physical activity tobacco alcohol use bmi diagnosis diabetes hypertension medical comorbiditie collect lipid profile measure fast peripheral venous blood sample standard laboratory technique lipid abnormality classify base ncep atp iii criterion proportion lipid abnormality compare population proportion z test risk factor associate dyslipidemia analyze multivariate logistic regression model prevalence high total cholesterol tc low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c significantly great urban rural population tc p ldl c p respectively prevalence low high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c p high triglyceride tg p lipid risk ratio tc hdl c tg hdl c ldl c hdl c high rural urban population female urban rural population high risk have multiple lipid abnormality risk factor assess diabetes overweight obesity physical inactivity associate increase risk certain lipid abnormality association pronounce urban population age indians rural urban setting alarmingly high prevalence lipid abnormality consider elevated cardiovascular disease risk associate lipid abnormality target intervention community necessary reduce disease burden
Overweight and Obesity in Pediatric Kidney Transplant Recipients Are Not Associated With Higher Risks of Early Postoperative Complications.,"Childhood overweight and obesity have been hypothesized to pose challenges in pediatric kidney transplantation due to potential complications and resultant worse outcomes. Herein, we aimed to determine if pediatric patients with an elevated body mass index (BMI) (> 85th percentile) are at higher risk for short-term complications following kidney transplantation. Following a review of our transplant database (2010-2020), patients > 2-18 years were assigned to groups based on BMI percentiles at the time of surgery: normal (5th-85th percentile; n = 120) and obese/overweight (> 85th percentile; n = 60). Patients were matched using a 1-to-2-ratio nearest-neighbor propensity score matching adjusting for underlying diagnosis, sex, and age. The primary outcome was postoperative complications classified according to Clavien-Dindo, and secondary outcomes included postoperative creatinine and kidney graft rejection. One hundred eighty patients (n = 120 in the control and n = 60 in the overweight and obese group) were included. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications (72/120 vs. 40/60, p = 0.42). We noted no difference in nadir creatinine (7 days, [interquartile range (IQR) 1, 679] and 9 days, [IQR 1, 690], p = 0.11), postoperative creatinine levels at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-transplantation, or rejection rates (8.4% and 8.4%, p > 0.99) between normal weighed and obese/overweight patients. However, more overweight and obese patients required intraoperative blood transfusions (55% and 33.4%, p = 0.006) and longer hospital stays (18.0 [IQR 9, 133] and 15.0 [IQR 7, 49], p = 0.02). It appears as though overweight and obese pediatric kidney transplant patients do not experience more postoperative complications. We propose that overweight and obesity should not be considered criteria to exclude pediatric patients from undergoing kidney transplantations.",childhood overweight obesity hypothesize pose challenge pediatric kidney transplantation potential complication resultant bad outcome aim determine pediatric patient elevated body mass index bmi percentile high risk short term complication follow kidney transplantation follow review transplant database patient year assign group base bmi percentile time surgery normal percentile n obese overweight percentile n patient match ratio near neighbor propensity score matching adjust underlie diagnosis sex age primary outcome postoperative complication classify accord clavien dindo secondary outcome include postoperative creatinine kidney graft rejection eighty patient n control n overweight obese group include significant difference postoperative complication p note difference nadir creatinine day interquartile range iqr day iqr p postoperative creatinine level month post transplantation rejection rate p normal weigh obese overweight patient overweight obese patient require intraoperative blood transfusion p long hospital stay iqr iqr p appear overweight obese pediatric kidney transplant patient experience postoperative complication propose overweight obesity consider criterion exclude pediatric patient undergo kidney transplantation

High prevalence of metabolic obesity in India: The ICMR-INDIAB national study (ICMR-INDIAB-23).,"Background & objectives While obesity usually produces cardio-metabolic dysfunction, some obese individuals are metabolically healthy, and conversely, some nonobese individuals have significant metabolic dysfunction. This study aims to assess the national prevalence of various obesity subtypes and their association with type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study. Methods The ICMR-INDIAB study is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of 1,13,043 individuals aged ≥20 yr from urban and rural areas across 31 Indian States and Union Territories. In every fifth individual (n=19,370), venous blood glucose and lipids were measured. A body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 was defined as being obese, and metabolic obesity was diagnosed if two risk factors, out of the following: high waist circumference, high blood pressure, elevated blood glucose, raised serum triglycerides, or low HDL cholesterol, were present. Four subgroups were identified: Metabolically Healthy Non-Obese (MHNO), Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO), Metabolically Obese Non-Obese (MONO), and Metabolically Obese Obese (MOO). Results The prevalence of various obesity subtypes was as follows: MONO: 43.3 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 42.6-44%], MOO: 28.3 per cent (27.7-28.9%), MHNO: 26.6 per cent (26-27.2%), and MHO: 1.8 per cent (1.6-2%). MONO was more prevalent in rural areas [Rural vs. Urban: MONO: 46 per cent (45-46.9%) vs. 39.6 per cent (37.8-41.3%), P<0.001]. MOO showed the highest risk for T2D and CAD, while MONO showed the highest risk of CKD, especially among females. Interpretation & conclusions Individuals with MONO have a distinct phenotype with adverse metabolic consequences, highlighting the need to shift from body weight-focused approaches to broader strategies to identify and tackle non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in India.",background objective obesity usually produce cardio metabolic dysfunction obese individual metabolically healthy conversely nonobese individual significant metabolic dysfunction study aim assess national prevalence obesity subtype association type diabetes coronary artery disease cad chronic kidney disease ckd indian council medical research india diabetes icmr indiab study method icmr indiab study nationally representative cross sectional survey individual age yr urban rural area indian state union territory fifth individual venous blood glucose lipid measure body mass index bmi kg define obese metabolic obesity diagnose risk factor follow high waist circumference high blood pressure elevated blood glucose raise serum triglyceride low hdl cholesterol present subgroup identify metabolically healthy non obese mhno metabolically healthy obese mho metabolically obese non obese mono metabolically obese obese moo result prevalence obesity subtype follow mono cent confidence interval ci moo cent mhno cent mho cent mono prevalent rural area rural urban mono cent cent moo show high risk cad mono show high risk ckd especially female interpretation conclusion individual mono distinct phenotype adverse metabolic consequence highlight need shift body weight focus approach broad strategy identify tackle non communicable disease ncds india
Retrospective Analysis of the Efficacy of Integrated Lifestyle Modifications in Managing Prediabetes in the Indian Population.,"<b>Background:</b> Prediabetes is a growing health concern in India, with a prevalence of 15.3%. This retrospective study was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of an integrated intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) in Indian patients with prediabetes while exploring sex- and body mass index (BMI)-based differences. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective study analyzed data from 427 patients with prediabetes (HbA1c: 5.7%-6.4% not on insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents and aged 18-75 years) who underwent a 1-year online ILI program at the Freedom from Diabetes Clinic, India, between 2020 and 2023. The intervention consisted of a personalized plant-based diet, physical activity, psychological support, and medical management. Anthropometric and biochemical data were extracted from the clinical database, and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with prediabetes remission. <b>Results:</b> At the end of the study, 47.1% of patients achieved prediabetes remission. Significant weight loss and improvements were observed in HbA1c, BMI, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, lipid profile, and blood pressure (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Notably, 34% of patients lost > 10% of their body weight. Females achieved greater reductions in weight and BMI than males (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The BMI stratified analysis revealed higher remission rates in the obesity group (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (49.9%) than in the nonobesity group (BMI 18-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (37.0%) (<i>p</i> = 0.028). The obesity group showed greater improvements in glycemic parameters and insulin resistance than the nonobesity group (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

Overweight risk in early adolescence according to children's BMI growth channelling changes in international growth standard/references.,"To compare the international BMI standard/references of the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF), MULT and the WHO and to analyse the association between changes in BMI growth channelling (BMI-GC) during childhood and the risk of being overweight in early adolescence. Participant data from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), young lives (YL) and Generation XXI (G21) cohorts were obtained at three time points. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and the weighted Kappa coefficient were used to assess the agreement among the BMI standard/references. The relative risk (RR) of being overweight at 9·5-13·5 years, based on an increase in BMI-GC (amplitude ≥ 0·67) between 3·5-6 years and 6·5-9 years, was calculated, with estimates adjusted for sex, ethnicity and socio-economic status. Ethiopia, India, Portugal, Vietnam and United Kingdom. Totally, 12 624 participants from the MCS, YL and G21 studies. The prevalence of overweight across the three ages groups was higher when using the WHO standard/reference (12·8-25·9 %) compared with the MULT (17·1-22·9 %) and IOTF (13·0-19·3 %) references. However, substantial agreement (0·95 < CCC ≤ 0·99) was found among these standard/references. Children who increased their BMI-GC by ≥ 0·67 and < 0·86 were more likely to be overweight at 9·5-13·5 years (MULT-RR = 2·49, 95 % CI: 2·00, 3·09/ WHO-RR = 2·47, 95 % CI: 1·96, 3·12/ IOTF-RR = 2·31, 95 % CI: 1·82, 2·93), compared with those who have stayed in their BMI-GC. A change in the BMI-GC among normal-weight children during childhood was associated with a significantly higher risk of being overweight at 9·5-13·5 years. These findings suggest that monitoring BMI-GC in children could be a tool to intervene and to prevent overweight in early adolescence.",compare international bmi standard reference international obesity task force iotf mult analyse association change bmi growth channelling bmi gc childhood risk overweight early adolescence participant datum millennium cohort study mcs young life yl generation xxi cohort obtain time point lin concordance correlation coefficient ccc weighted kappa coefficient assess agreement bmi standard reference relative risk rr overweight year base increase bmi gc amplitude year year calculate estimate adjust sex ethnicity socio economic status ethiopia india portugal vietnam united kingdom totally participant mcs yl study prevalence overweight age group high standard reference compare mult iotf reference substantial agreement ccc find standard reference child increase bmi gc likely overweight year mult rr ci rr ci iotf rr ci compare stay bmi gc change bmi gc normal weight child childhood associate significantly high risk overweight year finding suggest monitor bmi gc child tool intervene prevent overweight early adolescence
Influence of Age and Sex on the Clinical Profile of Metabolic Syndrome in Diabetic Patients.,"Background and aim In the 21st century, the rise in metabolic syndrome (MetS) prevalence has made it a global concern due to a higher risk of coronary artery disease and overall mortality, especially in India. Diabetic patients are more susceptible to metabolic syndrome. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the various risk factors associated with diabetes that contribute to the development of MetS. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MetS and assess the risk factors and individual components of MetS in diabetic patients across both sexes and various age groups. Material and methods This cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in diabetic adults who visited the general medicine outpatient department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Mangalagiri. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. The collected data were analyzed according to the guidelines of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) Joint Scientific Statement (2009) for MetS diagnosis. Results A total of 388 patients with diabetes mellitus were included in this study. The mean age was 52.55±11.82 years, with 20-59 years accounting for 69.6% (n=270) and ≥60 years for 30.4% (n=118). The proportion of males was 52.3% (n=203) of the study population. A high prevalence of MetS was reported (n=316; 81.4%). The prevalence of MetS was slightly higher in the 20-59 years age group (82.6%, n=223) compared to those ≥60 years (78.8%, n=93). A strong correlation between female sex and central obesity (n=168, 90.8%; p<0.001) and lower HDL-C levels (n=146, 78.9%; p<0.001) was present. A significant correlation was found between comorbidities, including hypertension (n=164, 86.3%, p=0.016), dyslipidemia (n=92, 88.5%, p=0.031), and the prevalence of MetS. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that waist circumference (odds ratio {OR}: 1.1; p=0.016), systolic blood pressure (OR: 1.09; p=0.016), fasting blood glucose (OR: 1.02; p=0.044), and triglycerides (OR: 1.02; p=0.025) were independent predictors of MetS. Conclusion This study shows a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) among diabetic patients, with females showing higher prevalence of MetS and its components, particularly central obesity and low HDL-C levels. The study also found statistically significant associations between MetS and glycemic parameters such as postprandial blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These findings emphasize the need for targeted screening and early intervention, particularly among female and younger diabetic patients. Public health initiatives focusing on lifestyle modifications and glycemic control are essential to mitigate MetS complications. Due to sociocultural diversities, region-specific studies are needed to develop localized guidelines for the effective management and prevention of metabolic syndrome.",background aim century rise metabolic syndrome met prevalence global concern high risk coronary artery disease overall mortality especially india diabetic patient susceptible metabolic syndrome crucial determine risk factor associate diabete contribute development met study aim determine prevalence met assess risk factor individual component met diabetic patient sex age group material method cross sectional prospective study conduct diabetic adult visit general medicine outpatient department india institute medical sciences aiims mangalagiri patient meet inclusion criterion enrol study collect datum analyze accord guideline international diabetes federation idf american heart association national heart lung blood institute aha nhlbi joint scientific statement met diagnosis result total patient diabetes mellitus include study mean age year year account year proportion male study population high prevalence met report prevalence met slightly high year age group compare year strong correlation female sex central obesity low hdl c level present significant correlation find comorbiditie include hypertension dyslipidemia prevalence met multivariable logistic regression analysis reveal waist circumference odd ratio systolic blood pressure fast blood glucose triglyceride independent predictor met conclusion study show high prevalence metabolic syndrome met diabetic patient female show high prevalence met component particularly central obesity low hdl c level study find statistically significant association met glycemic parameter postprandial blood sugar hemoglobin finding emphasize need targeted screening early intervention particularly female young diabetic patient public health initiative focus lifestyle modification glycemic control essential mitigate met complication sociocultural diversity region specific study need develop localize guideline effective management prevention metabolic syndrome
"Unveiling Childhood Health: A Rural Cross-Sectional Study of Nutritional Status among Under-Five Children in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu.","Malnutrition has emerged as a significant global concern, exacerbated by modernization and the pervasive influence of Western culture. Poor dietary habits and lifestyle shifts have rendered populations, particularly children, more vulnerable to both undernutrition and overnutrition. Alterations in dietary patterns among children under 5 years have contributed to a rise in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases in adulthood, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. This research aims to assess the prevalence and determinants of malnutrition among children aged 6-59 months in the rural areas of Chengalpattu district. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 420 children aged 6-59 months in the rural village of Chengalpattu. Multistage random sampling was employed to select participants, and data were collected using a pre-tested, validated semi-structured questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 26, and Chi-square tests were performed to assess the associations. The univariate analysis was followed by a multivariate logistic regression to identify significant predictors. Overall rate of malnutrition was 46.2%, with 30.2% stunted, 21% wasted, and 24.3% underweight. Malnutrition was statistically significant with gender, low socioeconomic status, breastfeeding initiation after 1 hour of birth, Integrated Child Development Services beneficiary, mode of delivery, birth order, and parental educational status of the children. The study results indicate that undernutrition remains a significant health concern among children under 5 years of age. Addressing issues such as low living standards, hunger, malnutrition, illiteracy, inadequate antenatal care, and poor sanitary and housing facilities is crucial. Effectively implementing existing policies and initiatives aimed at improving these conditions is essential.",malnutrition emerge significant global concern exacerbate modernization pervasive influence western culture poor dietary habit lifestyle shift render population particularly child vulnerable undernutrition overnutrition alteration dietary pattern child year contribute rise prevalence noncommunicable disease adulthood include obesity diabetes hypertension coronary heart disease research aim assess prevalence determinant malnutrition child age month rural area chengalpattu district cross sectional study carry child age month rural village chengalpattu multistage random sampling employ select participant datum collect pre tested validate semi structured questionnaire datum analyze spss version chi square test perform assess association univariate analysis follow multivariate logistic regression identify significant predictor overall rate malnutrition stunt waste underweight malnutrition statistically significant gender low socioeconomic status breastfeed initiation hour birth integrate child development service beneficiary mode delivery birth order parental educational status child study result indicate undernutrition remain significant health concern child year age address issue low living standard hunger malnutrition illiteracy inadequate antenatal care poor sanitary housing facility crucial effectively implement exist policy initiative aim improve condition essential
"MASLD Pharmacotherapy: Current Standards, Emerging Treatments, and Practical Guidance for Indian Physicians.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has become a significant public health issue worldwide, with a pronounced impact in India due to the escalating rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) driving its prevalence. This condition spans a range of hepatic disorders, from uncomplicated steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), accompanied by differing levels of hepatic fibrosis, heightening the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and cardiovascular complications. While lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of MASLD management, pharmacologic therapies are increasingly recognized as essential for patients with progressive disease or those at higher risk of complications. Recent insights into the pathogenesis of MASLD have led to the development of innovative therapies targeting key mechanisms such as hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis. Several pharmacological agents have shown encouraging results in clinical trials, including thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist resmetirom, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) like semaglutide, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists such as pioglitazone and saroglitazar, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and vitamin E. Furthermore, emerging therapies, including the dual incretin agonist tirzepatide and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) analogs, hold the potential to transform future treatment strategies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current and evolving pharmacologic options for MASLD, with a focus on practical recommendations tailored for Indian physicians. A structured treatment algorithm for noncirrhotic MASLD (F0-F3 fibrosis) is presented, incorporating only drugs currently available in India and stratified based on diabetes status and hepatic fibrosis severity. Given India's vast and diverse patient population, ensuring access to cost-effective therapies remains a challenge, necessitating a pragmatic approach that balances efficacy, affordability, and real-world feasibility. This review serves as a practical clinical guide, equipping physicians with evidence-based recommendations to optimize MASLD management in routine practice.",metabolic dysfunction associate steatotic liver disease masld know nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld significant public health issue worldwide pronounce impact india escalate rate obesity type diabetes mellitus dm drive prevalence condition span range hepatic disorder uncomplicated steatosis metabolic dysfunction associate steatohepatitis mash accompany differ level hepatic fibrosis heighten likelihood progression cirrhosis liver cancer cardiovascular complication lifestyle modification remain cornerstone masld management pharmacologic therapy increasingly recognize essential patient progressive disease high risk complication recent insight pathogenesis masld lead development innovative therapy target key mechanism hepatic steatosis insulin resistance inflammation hepatic fibrosis pharmacological agent show encourage result clinical trial include thyroid hormone receptor β agonist resmetirom glucagon like receptor agonist like semaglutide peroxisome proliferator activate receptor ppar agonist pioglitazone saroglitazar sodium glucose inhibitor vitamin furthermore emerge therapy include dual incretin agonist tirzepatide fibroblast growth factor fgf analog hold potential transform future treatment strategy review provide comprehensive overview current evolve pharmacologic option masld focus practical recommendation tailor indian physician structured treatment algorithm noncirrhotic masld fibrosis present incorporate drug currently available india stratify base diabetes status hepatic fibrosis severity give india vast diverse patient population ensure access cost effective therapy remain challenge necessitate pragmatic approach balance efficacy affordability real world feasibility review serve practical clinical guide equip physician evidence base recommendation optimize masld management routine practice
Assessment of Noncommunicable Disease Risk Factors among Midday Meal Cooking Staff in Vijayapura Schools: A Cross-sectional Study.,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), frequently called as lifestyle diseases, are a significant concern. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, NCDs are to account for >60% of all deaths occurring in India. The study aimed to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the prevalence of these diseases, dietary habits, physical inactivity, and behaviors such as tobacco use among the cooking staff of midday meals (MDMs) in schools and in finding out their overall knowledge, perception, and practices concerning NCDs such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. A cross-sectional study design was implemented with 290 cooking staff from schools in Vijayapura district, Karnataka. Their sociodemographic profiles, diet habits, physical activity, blood pressure, and anthropometric measurements were gathered using a prestructured questionnaire. A statistical test package for the social sciences (version 20) was used for the statistical study. The study found that most of the participants (41.4%) were from 30 to 40 years age-group. Overall, 38.3% of the participants were overweight, while 24.1% were classified as obese. Hypertension was observed in 32.4%, and 10.7% of the research participants were prehypertensive. Diabetes was present in 3.4%, and 13.4% of the research participants were prediabetic. Substandard dietary habits, blood pressure, and physical inactivity were seen as the most prevalent modifiable risk factors within these cooking personnel.

"Prevalence, risk factors, and predictors of hypertension among the Nyishi Tribe of Arunachal Pradesh.","This study investigates the prevalence of obesity and hypertension, along with associated risk factors, among the Nyishi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh. A cross-sectional study was performed involving 208 Nyishi adults (108 males, 100 females), aged 2050 years. The anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were measured in accordance with standard procedures. Statistical analyses, including Pearson correlation, binary logistic regression, and ROC curve, were performed. The nutritional statuses of the overweight and obese are 27.8% and 8.3% in males and 26% and 7% in females. In accordance with the waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and waist-height ratio, 15.7% men and 63% women; 31.5% men and 79% women; and 27.8% men and 70% women of adult Nyishi are at risk for central obesity. Binary logistic regression underscored significant associations between hypertension and overweight, obesity, WC, WHtR, age, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, anxiety, salt intake, pan use, and tobacco. Among males, inactivity (OR = 8.33) and alcohol consumption (OR = 6.04), and among females, tobacco use (OR = 7.41) and paan consumption (OR = 6.40) emerged as high-risk factors for hypertension. ROC curve analysis revealed that waist circumference exhibited the highest AUC (0.718) for males, while BMI had the highest AUC (0.708) for females. This indicates that Nyishi individuals, especially males with a waist circumference exceeding 80.50 cm and females with a BMI surpassing 22.75 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, face an elevated risk of developing hypertension. The research underscores the predictive significance of BMI and central obesity in the risk of hypertension.

Prevalence of Vitamin B12 Deficiency in Type 2 Diabetic Patients on Long-Term Metformin Therapy.,"Vitamin B12 deficiency is a recognized complication in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergoing long-term metformin therapy. Despite metformin's widespread use due to its efficacy and safety profile, it has been associated with reduced absorption of vitamin B12, which can lead to hematologic and neurologic complications. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency and its associated risk factors among T2DM patients on prolonged metformin therapy in Peshawar, Pakistan. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the outpatient departments of tertiary care hospitals in Peshawar from October 2024 to April 2025. A total of 320 T2DM patients aged 18 years and above who had been on metformin therapy were included. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and medical records, and serum vitamin B12 levels were measured using blood samples. Deficiency was defined as <200 pg/mL, borderline as 200-300 pg/mL, and normal as >300 pg/mL. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US), applying chi-square tests to assess associations. Out of 329 participants, 65.7% (n=216) had vitamin B12 deficiency, 24.3% (n=80) had borderline levels, and only 10% (n=33) had normal vitamin B12 levels. A statistically significant association was found between vitamin B12 deficiency and increasing age (p=0.003), higher BMI (p=0.012), longer duration of diabetes (p=0.025), and prolonged metformin use (p<0.001). The study reveals a high prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency among T2DM patients on long-term metformin therapy. The deficiency is significantly associated with older age, obesity, longer diabetes duration, and extended metformin use. Routine screening and early supplementation of vitamin B12 should be considered in diabetic patients on prolonged metformin treatment to prevent potential complications.",vitamin deficiency recognize complication patient type diabetes mellitus dm undergo long term metformin therapy despite metformin widespread use efficacy safety profile associate reduced absorption vitamin lead hematologic neurologic complication study aim determine prevalence vitamin deficiency associated risk factor dm patient prolong metformin therapy peshawar pakistan descriptive cross sectional study conduct outpatient department tertiary care hospital peshawar october april total dm patient age year metformin therapy include datum collect structured questionnaire medical record serum vitamin level measure blood sample deficiency define pg ml borderline pg ml normal pg ml datum analyze spss version ibm corp armonk ny apply chi square test assess association participant vitamin deficiency borderline level normal vitamin level statistically significant association find vitamin deficiency increase age high bmi long duration diabetes prolong metformin use study reveal high prevalence vitamin deficiency dm patient long term metformin therapy deficiency significantly associate old age obesity long diabete duration extend metformin use routine screening early supplementation vitamin consider diabetic patient prolong metformin treatment prevent potential complication
Obesity care knowledge and practice among primary care physicians in Klang valley: a cross-sectional study.,"Obesity has become a public health concern as its prevalence has increased rapidly around the world, including Malaysia. Primary care physicians (PCPs) are the first point of contact for obese patients, playing a crucial role in managing obesity. This study aims to determine the level of obesity care knowledge and practices among PCPs and to identify factors associated with them. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire distributed physically and online to PCPs. Pearson Chi-Square test was used to identify associations between demographic characteristics and obesity-related knowledge while the relationship between knowledge and practice scores was explored using regression analysis. A total of 126 PCPs participated in the study. Of these, 72% demonstrated a good level of knowledge, and 66% showed good practices in obesity care. Use of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) was significantly associated with higher knowledge scores, while both CPG use and prior training were significantly associated with better practice scores (p < 0.05). A moderate positive correlation was observed between knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.397, p < 0.001). PCPs have good obesity care knowledge and practice. Those using CPGs and with training were better prepared, resulting in improved practices. Enhancing awareness of these factors is crucial for future knowledge and practice improvements.",obesity public health concern prevalence increase rapidly world include malaysia primary care physician pcps point contact obese patient play crucial role manage obesity study aim determine level obesity care knowledge practice pcp identify factor associate cross sectional study conduct self administer questionnaire distribute physically online pcp pearson chi square test identify association demographic characteristic obesity relate knowledge relationship knowledge practice score explore regression analysis total pcp participate study demonstrate good level knowledge show good practice obesity care use clinical practice guideline cpgs significantly associate high knowledge score cpg use prior training significantly associate well practice score p moderate positive correlation observe knowledge practice score r p pcp good obesity care knowledge practice cpgs training well prepare result improve practice enhance awareness factor crucial future knowledge practice improvement
Comparative Analysis of Gender-Specific Patterns of Traditional Coronary Artery Disease Risk Factors and QRISK3 Scores in First-Degree Relatives of Coronary Artery Disease Patients.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death globally, with genetic and lifestyle factors contributing to its development. The first-degree relatives of CAD patients are at increased risk due to shared genetics and environments. This study aimed to perform a comparative analysis of gender-specific patterns of traditional CAD risk factors and QRISK3 scores in the first-degree relatives of CAD patients. <b>Study Design:</b> A cross-sectional study. This study enrolled 4,485 participants of first-degree relatives of patients who had been admitted to the hospital for CAD. Gender-specific comparisons were conducted in the first-degree relatives of CAD to assess traditional risk factors and QRISK3 scores. The mean age of patients was 41.8 years, with males comprising 66% of participants in our study. Males exhibited more traditional risk factors, including higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, smoking, alcohol, junk food consumption, and oral tobacco use. Females had a higher prevalence of obesity, inadequate sleep, depression, and migraines. Males had a significantly higher 10-year CAD risk according to QRISK3 scores, reflecting an increased healthy heart age of 4.20±1.32 years compared to their chronological age (<i>P</i>=0.0004). The prevalence of coronary risk factors was twice as high in the first-degree male relatives of individuals with known CAD compared to females. Distinct gender-based differences were found in risk factors and QRISK3 scores, highlighting the significance of specific approaches in evaluating and managing the risk of CAD within this high-risk group.",coronary artery disease cad lead cause death globally genetic lifestyle factor contribute development degree relative cad patient increase risk share genetic environment study aim perform comparative analysis gender specific pattern traditional cad risk factor score degree relative cad patient b study cross sectional study study enrol participant degree relative patient admit hospital cad gender specific comparison conduct degree relative cad assess traditional risk factor score mean age patient year male comprise participant study male exhibit traditional risk factor include high systolic diastolic blood pressure dyslipidaemia smoking alcohol junk food consumption oral tobacco use female high prevalence obesity inadequate sleep depression migraine male significantly high year cad risk accord score reflect increase healthy heart age year compare chronological age prevalence coronary risk factor twice high degree male relative individual know cad compare female distinct gender base difference find risk factor score highlight significance specific approach evaluate manage risk cad high risk group
Diet and physical activity intervention strategies to reduce obesity among students in South India: A narrative review.,"Adolescent obesity and overweight cases are highly prevalent in emerging nations undergoing nutritional transition. Obesity is associated with significant comorbidities and health issues, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, orthopedic issues, low self-esteem, and diminished quality of life. Research has shown that well-designed interventions are required to lower the risk of obesity and the burden of death and morbidity related to noncommunicable illnesses. A Cochrane review discovered that interventions combining diet, exercise, and other behavioral facets appear to be more effective in controlling obesity. Adult weight-loss interventions are not very successful, which highlights the need to prevent childhood obesity.",adolescent obesity overweight case highly prevalent emerge nation undergo nutritional transition obesity associate significant comorbiditie health issue include diabete mellitus hypertension coronary artery disease orthopedic issue low self esteem diminish quality life research show design intervention require lower risk obesity burden death morbidity relate noncommunicable illness cochrane review discover intervention combine diet exercise behavioral facet appear effective control obesity adult weight loss intervention successful highlight need prevent childhood obesity
"Cardiovascular, kidney related, and weight loss effects of therapeutics for type 2 diabetes: a living clinical practice guideline.","What are the benefits and harms of medications for adults with type 2 diabetes at varied risks of cardiovascular and kidney related complications? Emerging clinical trials of novel medications have demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular, kidney, and weight related outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. Dynamically updated practice guidelines adhering to standards of trustworthiness are necessary in response to a rapidly evolving evidence base and the availability of multiple medication alternatives. This living practice guideline incorporates the latest available medications and evidence and provides recommendations stratified by risks of cardiovascular and kidney complications to inform diabetes management. The panel issued risk-stratified recommendations regarding four prioritised medications for adults with type 2 diabetes (SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, finerenone and tirzepatide):• Lower risk (three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)): weak recommendation against SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Moderate risk (more than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD; or established CVD and/or CKD at lower risk of complications): weak recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation against finerenone in adults with CKD.• Higher risk (established CVD and/or CKD at higher risk of complications, or established heart failure): strong recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation in favour of finerenone in adults with CKD.• Across risk strata: weak recommendation in favour of tirzepatide in adults with obesity. An international panel including two patient partners, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations. The panel followed standards for trustworthy guidelines and used the GRADE approach, explicitly considering the balance of benefits, harms and burdens of treatment from an individual patient perspective. Recommendations were informed by a linked living systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluating relative benefits and harms updated to 31 July 2024; and by linked systematic reviews addressing risk prediction models and values and preferences of adults with type 2 diabetes. Candidate therapeutics are prioritised based on availability of sufficient randomised trial data, relevance to a global audience and likelihood of changing practice.This is the first version of the living guideline. The guideline is part of the <i>BMJ Rapid Recommendations</i> series. MAGICapp displays the most recent version of the guideline and full content including evidence summaries and decision aids; major updates will be published in <i>The BMJ</i>.

The association between Dietary Obesity-Prevention Score (DOS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D): a case-control study.,"The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to rise, with dietary patterns recognized as a major contributing factor in its development. The Dietary Obesity-Prevention Score (DOS) is a validated tool designed to evaluate adherence to dietary behaviors associated with obesity prevention. This case-control study aimed to examine the association between adherence to the DOS and the risk of developing T2D. Participants were recruited from individuals attending medical clinics affiliated with King Khalid University in Abha, Saudi Arabia. The study included adults aged 18-60 years, comprising 250 newly diagnosed T2D cases (diagnosed within the past 6 months) and 250 healthy controls. Dietary intake was carefully assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which covered a comprehensive list of 152 food items. The DOS is a validated index derived from 14 food groups known to be associated with changes in body weight. Participants diagnosed with T2D exhibited significantly higher mean body weight (71. vs. 65.3 kg) and BMI (29.4 vs. 26.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Participants in the highest tertile of the DOS exhibited significantly greater intakes of energy, carbohydrates, various micronutrients, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, alongside lower consumption of saturated fatty acids, refined grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages (<i>p</i> < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed for these dietary components between the case and control groups. Higher adherence to the DOS was linked to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. After adjusting for potential confounders-including age, sex, energy intake, education, marital status, waist circumference, Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), physical activity, and BMI-those in the highest DOS tertile demonstrated a 42% reduction in the odds of developing T2D compared to individuals in the lowest tertile (OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38-0.87; P-trend = 0.038). Higher adherence to DOS score associated with a lower risk of T2D among Saudi adults. To validate these findings and clarify the underlying causal mechanisms, further longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials are warranted.",global prevalence type diabetes continue rise dietary pattern recognize major contributing factor development dietary obesity prevention score dos validated tool design evaluate adherence dietary behavior associate obesity prevention case control study aim examine association adherence do risk develop participant recruit individual attend medical clinic affiliate king khalid university abha saudi arabia study include adult age year comprise newly diagnose case diagnose past month healthy control dietary intake carefully assess validated semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire ffq cover comprehensive list food item do validated index derive food group know associate change body weight participant diagnose exhibit significantly high mean body weight kg bmi kg m compare control group participant high tertile do exhibit significantly great intake energy carbohydrate micronutrient fruit vegetable grain legume alongside low consumption saturate fatty acid refined grain sugar sweeten beverage statistically significant difference observe dietary component case control group high adherence do link reduced risk type diabetes adjust potential confounder include age sex energy intake education marital status waist circumference waist height ratio whtr physical activity bmi high do tertile demonstrate reduction odd develop compare individual low tertile ci p trend high adherence dos score associate low risk saudi adult validate finding clarify underlie causal mechanism longitudinal study randomize control trial warrant
Future potential therapeutics to treat MASH.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive form of Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), poses a significant global health challenge due to its association with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular complications. Despite its rising prevalence, effective therapies remain limited. This review highlights emerging therapeutic strategies that target key pathways involved in MASH pathogenesis, including THR-β, FXR, PPAR, GLP-1RA, FGF21, and SGLT2. In addition, novel approaches such as gene therapy (siRNA), probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and stem cell therapy show promise for the treatment of MASH. Ongoing clinical trials and mechanistic insights into fibrosis, inflammation, and lipid metabolism provide hope for tailored, multi-targeted treatments. Future efforts must address safety, long-term efficacy, and non-invasive diagnostics to advance the management of MASH.",metabolic dysfunction associate steatohepatitis mash progressive form metabolic associate steatotic liver disease masld pose significant global health challenge association obesity type diabetes cardiovascular complication despite rise prevalence effective therapy remain limited review highlight emerge therapeutic strategy target key pathway involve mash pathogenesis include thr β fxr ppar addition novel approach gene therapy sirna probiotic fecal microbiota transplantation stem cell therapy promise treatment mash ongoing clinical trial mechanistic insight fibrosis inflammation lipid metabolism provide hope tailor multi target treatment future effort address safety long term efficacy non invasive diagnostic advance management mash
"Dyslipidemia and Its Associated Factors Among People Living With HIV on Dolutegravir-Based Antiretroviral Therapy at Debre Markos Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study.","<b>Background:</b> Dyslipidemia is a prevalent public health concern among individuals living with HIV who are undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART), and it increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the introduction of improved medications like dolutegravir, there are limited data regarding the extent of dyslipidemia in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia and its associated factors among people living with HIV on dolutegravir-based ART. <b>Methods:</b> An institutional-based cross-sectional study was carried out from December 1, 2021, to February 30, 2022. Sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory data were collected from 423 participants. Simple random sampling methods were used to recruit the participants. The collected data were entered in Epi-data Version 4.6 and analyzed via SPSS Version 26. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with dyslipidemia. A <i>p</i> value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of dyslipidemia was found to be 73.8%. Low HDL-C was the most common (61.2%), followed by elevated levels of TG (40.2%), high LDL-C (26%), and high TC (24.3%). Being female (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.04-3.02, <i>p</i>=0.034), insufficient physical activity (AOR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1-2.67, <i>p</i>=0.048), being overweight (AOR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.07-4.75, <i>p</i>=0.033), and being obese (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI: 0.86-6.25, <i>p</i>=0.045) were significantly associated with dyslipidemia. <b>Conclusion:</b> The prevalence of dyslipidemia among people living with HIV on a dolutegravir-based ART was high, occurring in nearly three-quarters of the participants. Being female, insufficient physical activity, and being overweight or obese were significantly associated with dyslipidemia among people living with HIV taking dolutegravir-based ART. Therefore, to avoid the disastrous effects of dyslipidemia, serum lipid profiles should be considered and evaluated in people living with HIV on a dolutegravir-based ART.",b dyslipidemia prevalent public health concern individual live hiv undergo antiretroviral therapy art increase risk cardiovascular disease despite introduction improved medication like dolutegravir limited datum extent dyslipidemia population purpose study determine prevalence dyslipidemia associated factor people live hiv dolutegravir base art b institutional base cross sectional study carry december february sociodemographic behavioral clinical anthropometric laboratory datum collect participant simple random sampling method recruit participant collect datum enter epi data version analyze spss version multivariable logistic regression determine factor associate dyslipidemia value consider statistically significant b prevalence dyslipidemia find low hdl c common follow elevated level tg high ldl c high tc female aor ci insufficient physical activity aor ci overweight aor ci obese aor ci significantly associate dyslipidemia b prevalence dyslipidemia people live hiv dolutegravir base art high occur nearly quarter participant female insufficient physical activity overweight obese significantly associate dyslipidemia people live hiv take dolutegravir base art avoid disastrous effect dyslipidemia serum lipid profile consider evaluate people live hiv dolutegravir base art
Prevalent User Bias in Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Studies: A Concept Simply Explained.,"Prevalent user bias, such as in the context of treatment with medication, occurs when a medication-using sample is attenuated by the experience of medication use, separating the original sample into former users and continuing users (""prevalent users""). Recruiting a sample after such a change has occurred results in a biased sample. This is problematic when the biasing influence is relevant to the outcome being studied. Three hypothetical studies are described to illustrate prevalent user bias: a cross-sectional study, a longitudinal observational study, and a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Concepts related to prevalent user bias are discussed. For example, this bias may help explain the well-known obesity paradox; and, performing completer analyses in RCTs is fallacious because it is an examination of outcomes in ""prevalent users."" Prevalent user bias can be avoided by recruiting only new users. If a study recruits ""prevalent users,"" contamination by prevalent user bias should be considered. Finally, in longitudinal studies, reasons for drop out should be ascertained to determine whether the reasons influence outcomes through the prevalent user bias.",prevalent user bias context treatment medication occur medication sample attenuate experience medication use separate original sample user continue user prevalent user recruit sample change occur result biased sample problematic bias influence relevant outcome study hypothetical study describe illustrate prevalent user bias cross sectional study longitudinal observational study randomize control trial rct concept relate prevalent user bias discuss example bias help explain know obesity paradox perform completer analysis rct fallacious examination outcome prevalent user prevalent user bias avoid recruit new user study recruit prevalent user contamination prevalent user bias consider finally longitudinal study reason drop ascertain determine reason influence outcome prevalent user bias
Type 2 diabetes in South Asians.,"Type 2 diabetes poses a substantial public health challenge in South Asia, marked by distinctive features in its pathogenesis, phenotype, and management. This review explores the characteristics of type 2 diabetes in South Asians who tend to develop the condition at a younger average age and lower body mass index than white populations. Prevalence is high and varies across the region, with recent increases in youth onset type 2 diabetes. Environmental influences are driving greater sedentary behavior, and dietary shifts towards processed foods are leading to higher body weights. This is concerning because South Asians show greater abdominal obesity, ectopic fat accumulation (particularly hepatic fat), and lower skeletal muscle mass than white people of a similar age and body mass index. These features, coupled with rapid β cell dysfunction, contribute to earlier onset and accelerated glycemia progression (greater aggregated hyperglycemia than white people), contributing to more retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Management of type 2 diabetes in the region is hindered by delayed diagnosis, inadequate healthcare access, and economic barriers limiting sustainable glucose, lipid, and blood pressure management. Evidence supports lifestyle and dietary weight loss as viable approaches to prevention and diabetes remission, respectively, though sustained remission is untested. Recently introduced drugs (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and newer glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) offer promise in weight management and cardiovascular and kidney protection, but are often inaccessible owing to cost constraints. Future efforts should prioritize affordable and innovative solutions, strengthen healthcare systems, and implement population wide preventive measures that account for the region's socioeconomic complexities, and practical contextual research.",type diabetes pose substantial public health challenge south asia mark distinctive feature pathogenesis phenotype management review explore characteristic type diabete south asians tend develop condition young average age low body mass index white population prevalence high vary region recent increase youth onset type diabetes environmental influence drive great sedentary behavior dietary shift process food lead high body weight concern south asians great abdominal obesity ectopic fat accumulation particularly hepatic fat low skeletal muscle mass white people similar age body mass index feature couple rapid β cell dysfunction contribute early onset accelerate glycemia progression great aggregate hyperglycemia white people contribute retinopathy cardiovascular disease chronic kidney disease management type diabete region hinder delay diagnosis inadequate healthcare access economic barrier limit sustainable glucose lipid blood pressure management evidence support lifestyle dietary weight loss viable approach prevention diabetes remission respectively sustain remission unteste recently introduce drug sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitor new glucagon like peptide receptor agonist offer promise weight management cardiovascular kidney protection inaccessible owe cost constraint future effort prioritize affordable innovative solution strengthen healthcare system implement population wide preventive measure account region socioeconomic complexity practical contextual research
Associations of prior wasting malnutrition with later indicators of glucose tolerance across 4 cohorts in Africa and Asia: The Severe Acute Malnutrition - the Role of the Pancreas (SAMPA) study.,"Prenatal or infant wasting malnutrition followed by later overweight is associated with increased risk of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. In a pooled analysis of 6 longitudinal cohorts, we investigated associations between prior malnutrition (PM) early in life or in adulthood and subsequent glycemic status. We identified cohorts in Tanzania, Zambia, India, and the Philippines in whom low birth weight or wasting malnutrition in childhood or as adults following human immunodeficiency virus or tuberculosis infection had been measured. Anthropometry, body composition, and glycemic status, determined by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and glucose at 120 min in an oral glucose tolerance test (glucose120), were assessed 3-38 y after PM and in non-PM (NPM) controls. HbA1c and glucose120 were compared between PM and NPM participants by linear regression, controlling for age, sex, and socioeconomic status and, in pooled analyses, for cohort also. In the full cohort of 2251 participants, there was no overall association between PM and diabetes risk. Child participants aged ∼12 y who were hospitalized with PM when <2 y had higher glucose120 compared to NPM (difference 0.50 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.91 mmol/L). In pooled analyses across adult cohorts controlling for cohort, age, sex, and socioeconomic status, PM participants, compared to NPM, may have higher glucose120 (difference 0.33 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.27, 0.92 mmol/L) if still underweight, and higher HbA1c (difference 0.41%; 95% CI: -0.07%, 0.89%) and glucose120 (difference 0.70 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.25, 1.66 mmol/L) if currently obese. Childhood PM is associated with greater adult dysglycemia, whereas adulthood PM may have heterogeneous outcomes dependent on subsequent presence/absence of weight gain. Clinicians and public health managers should be aware of the long-term risk and intervene to promote some weight gain but prevent excess weight gain in people who were previously malnourished.",prenatal infant wasting malnutrition follow later overweight associate increase risk chronic disease include type diabetes pool analysis longitudinal cohort investigate association prior malnutrition pm early life adulthood subsequent glycemic status identify cohort tanzania zambia india philippine low birth weight waste malnutrition childhood adult follow human immunodeficiency virus tuberculosis infection measure anthropometry body composition glycemic status determine hemoglobin glucose min oral glucose tolerance test assess y pm non pm npm control compare pm npm participant linear regression control age sex socioeconomic status pooled analysis cohort cohort participant overall association pm diabete risk child participant age y hospitalize pm y high compare npm difference mmol l ci mmol l pool analysis adult cohort control cohort age sex socioeconomic status pm participant compare npm high difference mmol l ci mmol l underweight high difference ci difference mmol l ci mmol l currently obese childhood pm associate great adult dysglycemia adulthood pm heterogeneous outcome dependent subsequent presence absence weight gain clinician public health manager aware long term risk intervene promote weight gain prevent excess weight gain people previously malnourish
Evaluating Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Young Healthcare Professionals: Insights from Q-Risk 3 Calculations.,"There is a global rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD), particularly among the current generation of young adults, including the health professionals. Factors such as poor lifestyle choices, inadequate nutrition, sedentary work, and prolonged working hours contribute to occupational stress. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of CVD risk factors in young healthcare workers aged 25-40 and assess their 10-year CVD risk using the QRISK 3 prediction algorithm. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 248 health workers aged 25-40 years in a tertiary care hospital in Pondicherry. Data collected include questionnaire responses for the QRISK 3 algorithm, weight, height, and two SBP readings on two different days, and blood samples for HDL-c, Fasting glucose, and Total cholesterol level. Nearly 26.6% of the participants had high body mass index (BMI), 5.24% had diabetes mellitus, 16.12% had hypertension, 25.4% were found with hyperlipidemia, 6.3% had a history of light smoking, and 47.5% had a family history of CVD. Most of the risk factors except hypertension and low HDL-c showed female preponderance. Despite the high prevalence, the mean QRISK score of a 10-year risk of getting CVD among young healthcare workers is less, which is only 1.3%. Though the prevalence of major risk factors is high among healthcare workers other risk factors that the QRISK 3 algorithm takes into consideration were very low among the participants. The higher prevalence of metabolic risk factors emphasizes the need for the change in lifestyle behaviors of participants.",global rise cardiovascular disease cvd particularly current generation young adult include health professional factor poor lifestyle choice inadequate nutrition sedentary work prolong working hour contribute occupational stress study aim investigate prevalence cvd risk factor young healthcare worker age assess year cvd risk qrisk prediction algorithm cross sectional study conduct health worker age year tertiary care hospital pondicherry datum collect include questionnaire response qrisk algorithm weight height sbp reading different day blood sample hdl c fast glucose total cholesterol level nearly participant high body mass index bmi diabete mellitus hypertension find hyperlipidemia history light smoking family history cvd risk factor hypertension low hdl c show female preponderance despite high prevalence mean qrisk score year risk get cvd young healthcare worker prevalence major risk factor high healthcare worker risk factor qrisk algorithm take consideration low participant high prevalence metabolic risk factor emphasize need change lifestyle behavior participant
Association of feeding and parenting styles with adiposity in young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesises global evidence on the different feeding and parenting styles, i.e., authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and uninvolved, and their association with adiposity in children from 6 months to 5 years of age. We searched PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science from Jan 1, 1900 to September 1, 2023, and updated the search on June 13, 2025. The primary outcome of interest was childhood adiposity. Statistical synthesis was performed using vote counting based on direction of effect, a method used for synthesizing results, by categorizing the effect of each study as beneficial or harmful based on the direction of effect. The inverse variance heterogeneity (IVhet) model, an estimator under the fixed effect model assumption with a quasi-likelihood-based variance structure, was used to conduct a meta-analysis. Of the 10,683 records screened, eight were eligible for the systematic review. These studies were conducted in high-income countries and the sample size ranged from 67 to 1238 participants. Of the eight records, three studies were eligible for meta-analysis and five studies were only eligible for vote counting based on direction of effect, as no effect estimates/95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Three of the five studies synthesized using the vote counting method, found demandingness, authoritative, permissive, neglectful and uninvolved styles to be negatively associated with adiposity in children. Meta-analysis revealed the estimated effects of authoritarian (β = 0·02, 95% CI - 0·07 to 0·11, I<sup>2</sup> = 22·2%, participants = 933), indulgent/permissive (β = 0·03, 95% CI - 0·02 to 0·26, I<sup>2</sup> = 58·9%, participants = 872) and uninvolved/neglectful (β = 0·05, 95% CI - 0·005 to 0·10, I<sup>2</sup> = 0·0%, participants = 835) styles on adiposity to be negligible. These findings suggest no consistent link between childhood adiposity and various feeding and parenting styles, including authoritarian, uninvolved, neglectful, and authoritative. Most studies had a high risk of bias, and the evidence quality was low. • To the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews have been conducted so far focusing on the association between feeding and parenting styles and adiposity in children aged 5 years and younger. • This systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies conducted in high income countries found no association between feeding and parenting styles and adiposity in 6 months - 5-year-old children. • Methodologically robust future studies are needed to understand the causal relationship of feeding and parenting styles on adiposity in children of this age group.",systematic review meta analysis synthesise global evidence different feeding parenting style authoritative authoritarian indulgent uninvolved association adiposity child month year age search pubmed ovid embase psycinfo web science jan september update search june primary outcome interest childhood adiposity statistical synthesis perform vote counting base direction effect method synthesize result categorize effect study beneficial harmful base direction effect inverse variance heterogeneity ivhet model estimator fix effect model assumption quasi likelihood base variance structure conduct meta analysis record screen eligible systematic review study conduct high income country sample size range participant record study eligible meta analysis study eligible vote counting base direction effect effect confidence interval cis report study synthesize vote counting method find demandingness authoritative permissive neglectful uninvolved style negatively associate adiposity child meta analysis reveal estimate effect authoritarian β ci participant indulgent permissive β ci participant uninvolved neglectful β ci participant style adiposity negligible finding suggest consistent link childhood adiposity feeding parenting style include authoritarian uninvolved neglectful authoritative study high risk bias evidence quality low good knowledge systematic review conduct far focus association feeding parenting style adiposity child age year young systematic review meta analysis longitudinal study conduct high income country find association feeding parenting style adiposity month year old child methodologically robust future study need understand causal relationship feeding parenting style adiposity child age group
Hyperglycaemia in pregnancy: the role of ethnicity and geography in risk and outcomes.,"The global prevalence of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) is rising alongside increases in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes. The IDF estimates that 19.7% of live births in 2024 were affected, with 79% of cases due to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 20% due to overt diabetes in pregnancy and pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy combined. HIP is linked to complications for both mother and child, including long-term health risks. Significant ethnic and geographical variations exist in the prevalence and outcomes of HIP, with women from South Asia being at the highest risk of GDM. Variations in prevalence of HIP exist both between regions (e.g. 13.8% in Africa compared with 31.8% in South-East Asia) and within individual countries. Social determinants of health, such as healthcare access and delivery, economic stability, discrimination, migration, lifestyle and other sociocultural factors, along with environmental, biological and genetic factors, contribute to these ethnic differences. Geography impacts risk through factors such as seasonality, pollution and rurality. Further variation occurs due to substantial diversity in national approaches to screening and diagnostic criteria. Ethnic disparities in GDM outcomes include variations in complications such as preeclampsia and preterm delivery. To address these disparities, a standardised and cost-effective approach to GDM screening and diagnosis that reflects the ethnic diversity in glucose profiles is recommended. Locally tailored, national prevention strategies for those with prior GDM should be introduced as a matter of urgency.

"Long COVID Syndrome, Mortality and Morbidity in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 From 16 Countries: The World Heart Federation Global COVID-19 Study.","Long-term adverse consequences of the COVID-19 infection affect many organ systems, which requires comprehensive understanding of the disease burden and determinants of persistent long COVID-19 symptoms in diverse population. However, data on long COVID complications are sparse, particularly from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The World Heart Federation (WHF) global study assessed the incidence of vascular complications, persistent long COVID symptoms and factors associated with mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients with COVID-19 up to one year after hospitalization. We recruited a total of 2535 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and followed up to one-year post-hospital discharge. We collected data on long COVID symptoms, quality of life, and clinical outcomes, including new onset diseases, MACE, and mortality at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 9-12 months post-discharge. Descriptive and generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression analysis was performed to assess the factors associated with mortality and MACE. The majority of participants were recruited from LMICs (64%) and male (56%) with a mean (SD) age of 59.5 (20.0) years. Among those tested for COVID-19 strain (52%), Omicron strain was the most prevalent (98%). The follow-up rate at one year was 90%. Over half of the participants (56%) reported experiencing at least one major long COVID symptom (fatigue, breathlessness, anxiety, chest pain, and palpitations) at 1-month, and one-quarter participants reported persistent long COVID symptoms at 9-12 months. On the EQ-5D scale, 49% reported difficulties in usual activities, 33% reported anxiety/depression, and 23% reported problems in mobility within the first 6 months. The most frequent new-onset illnesses were pulmonary embolism (8%), kidney disease (4%), and hypertension (3%). The cumulative all-cause mortality rate was 15% (n = 382) at one-year post-discharge. Long COVID symptoms were more common among females, individuals with pre-existing comorbidities, and those with more severe acute illness. Age, obesity, ICU admission, and underlying cardiovascular or pulmonary disease were associated with increased risk of mortality and MACE. The study showed a substantial burden of mortality and morbidity, and a quarter of patients reported at least one persistent long COVID symptom after one year. Our findings underscore the need for early identification and management of long COVID symptoms in LMICs.",long term adverse consequence infection affect organ system require comprehensive understanding disease burden determinant persistent long symptom diverse population datum long covid complication sparse particularly middle income country lmic world heart federation whf global study assess incidence vascular complication persistent long covid symptom factor associate mortality major adverse cardiovascular event mace patient year hospitalization recruit total patient hospitalize follow year post hospital discharge collect datum long covid symptom quality life clinical outcome include new onset disease mace mortality month post discharge descriptive generalized estimating equation gee regression analysis perform assess factor associate mortality mace majority participant recruit lmic male mean sd age year test strain omicron strain prevalent follow rate year half participant report experience major long covid symptom fatigue breathlessness anxiety chest pain palpitation month quarter participant report persistent long covid symptom month scale report difficulty usual activity report anxiety depression report problem mobility month frequent new onset illness pulmonary embolism kidney disease hypertension cumulative cause mortality rate n year post discharge long covid symptom common female individual pre existing comorbiditie severe acute illness age obesity icu admission underlie cardiovascular pulmonary disease associate increase risk mortality mace study show substantial burden mortality morbidity quarter patient report persistent long covid symptom year finding underscore need early identification management long covid symptom lmic
Prospects of Late-Stage Development Agents in the Treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH).,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a spectrum of pathology involving fatty liver disease that may progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. The prevalence of MASLD and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) continues to increase, mirroring the rise in global prevalence of related comorbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Due to the alarming rise of these comorbidities, a greater proportion of the population is at risk for developing MASLD and MASH. As such, there has been a significant effort to develop effective therapies for MASLD and MASH. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist, as the first treatment for patients with MASH. In India, the Drug Controller General of India approved saroglitazar, a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α/γ agonist, for the treatment of MASLD. Currently, we have various drug classes, including liver-specific therapies, in Phase 3 development with even more agents earlier in the pipeline. This review will discuss prospective therapies in later stages of development such as thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonists, PPAR agonists, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, fibroblast growth factor 21 agonists, and fatty acid synthase inhibitors.",metabolic dysfunction associate steatotic liver disease masld spectrum pathology involve fatty liver disease progress fibrosis cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma liver failure prevalence masld metabolic dysfunction associate steatohepatitis mash continue increase mirror rise global prevalence related comorbiditie obesity type diabete mellitus alarming rise comorbiditie great proportion population risk develop masld mash significant effort develop effective therapy masld mash recently food drug administration approve resmetirom selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist treatment patient mash india drug controller general india approve saroglitazar dual peroxisome proliferator activate receptor ppar α γ agonist treatment masld currently drug class include liver specific therapy phase development agent early pipeline review discuss prospective therapy later stage development thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist ppar agonist glucagon like receptor agonist fibroblast growth factor agonist fatty acid synthase inhibitor
Impact of 3D high-definition laparoscopy on total laparoscopic hysterectomy: a body mass index-stratified retrospective analysis.,"Three-dimensional (3D) high-definition (HD) laparoscopy is a promising tool in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery, offering enhanced depth perception and visualization. However, its role in total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), particularly in patients with varying body mass index (BMI), remains underexplored. To evaluate the impact of 3D HD laparoscopy on surgical efficiency and patient outcomes in TLH, with a focus on BMI-related differences. A single-center retrospective study. Sixty patients who underwent TLH were included: n=30 used 3D HD laparoscopy (Aesculap 3D EinsteinVision) and n=30 matched controls used 2D laparoscopy. Matching criteria included uterine weight and prior surgical history. Patients were stratified according to BMI (≤24.9, 25-29.9, ≥30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Operative time, vault suturing time, blood loss, trocar site incisions, haemoglobin drop, and complication rates. 60 patients (30 in each group). The 3D HD laparoscopy group demonstrated significant improvements across multiple outcomes. Trocar site incisions were significantly reduced in all BMI categories (<i>P</i> <.001). Vault suturing time was shorter in the 3D HD laparoscopy group (<i>P</i> =.002), and total operative time was reduced in overweight patients (<i>P</i> =.015). Obese patients in the 3D group had lower haemoglobin drop (<i>P</i> =.01) and reduced blood loss compared to 2D laparoscopy group (<i>P</i> =.017). 3D HD laparoscopy enhances surgical efficiency in TLH, especially in patients with higher BMI, by minimizing trocar site incisions, reducing vault suturing times, and improving hemostasis-highlighting its value in overcoming challenges of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery.

Renal Barocrinology: The Interface between Obesity and Kidney Health.,"Obesity is been acknowledged to be a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributing to both its onset and progression. Over past few decades, the obesity epidemic has lead to an increased incidence of obesityrelated nephropathy, characterised by glomerular hyperfiltration, hypertrophy, and progressive glomerulosclerosis. This review highlights the need for multidisciplinary action to prevent and manage obesityrelated nephropathy. We reiterate the current necessity of routine kidney function screening in people with obesity. We also propose an integrated concept of Renal Barocrinology. This will focus on early screening and preventive strategies, mitigating long-term burden of CKD and its complications, and improving patient outcomes through a collaborative approach.",obesity acknowledge major risk factor chronic kidney disease ckd contribute onset progression past decade obesity epidemic lead increase incidence obesityrelated nephropathy characterise glomerular hyperfiltration hypertrophy progressive glomerulosclerosis review highlight need multidisciplinary action prevent manage obesityrelated nephropathy reiterate current necessity routine kidney function screening people obesity propose integrated concept renal barocrinology focus early screening preventive strategy mitigate long term burden ckd complication improve patient outcome collaborative approach
"Non-autoimmune diabetes in young people from Assam, India: the PHENOEINDY-2 study.","In the Western world, non-autoimmune diabetes in the young is believed to be driven by overweight/obesity and insulin resistance. However, it is increasingly being reported in undernourished people in low- and middle-income countries, including India. We hypothesised that these patients would show markers of chronic undernutrition and a 'thin-fat' phenotype and be predominantly beta cell-deficient. We studied young patients (clinically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at <40 years) who attended the outpatient department of Assam Medical College and Hospital, Dibrugarh (in North-East India). We measured weight, height, waist and hip circumference, haemoglobin, fasting glucose, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, lipid, GADA and C-peptide levels, and body fat percentage (adiposity, assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), and calculated BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), body roundness index and HOMA indices. Volunteers from similar socioeconomic background with normal glucose tolerance (measured by 75 g OGTT) were assessed as control participants. We also compared the anthropometric characteristics and body composition of our participants with those of non-Hispanic white Americans from the NHANES study. The study included 252 control participants (136 male participants, median age 30 years, BMI 23.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 240 GADA-negative young patients with diabetes (155 male participants, age 36 years, BMI 23.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The majority of study participants came from a relatively impoverished population of tea garden workers ('tribal' workers). Of the patients with diabetes, 28% had stunted growth (male <161.2 cm, female <149.8 cm), 27% were anaemic, 68% were lean (BMI <25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, including 14% who were underweight [BMI <18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>]) and 32% were overweight/obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). When assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, 61% of control participants and 53% of patients had adiposity (body fat percentage >25% in male participants or >35% in female participants). Compared with a contemporary non-Hispanic white American population, Assamese control participants and diabetic patients had higher WHR, body roundness index, and total and truncal adiposity (assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) across the range of BMI, thus conforming to the description of the 'thin-fat' phenotype. The diabetic patients were severely beta cell-deficient (median HOMA-B 25.7) and only moderately insulin-resistant (median HOMA-S 103) with higher triacylglycerol and lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations than control participants. Underweight patients (<18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were the most hyperglycaemic (based on fasting plasma glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub>), and were severely beta cell-deficient but insulin-sensitive. As previously reported, two-thirds of these patients belonged to the severely insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) cluster according to the Swedish diabetes subgroup classification. Diabetes in the young people of this impoverished population is heterogeneous, but the majority of patients are not overweight/obese or insulin-resistant. Overall, these participants conform to the thin-fat phenotype, and their diabetes is predominantly driven by beta cell deficiency. The sociodemographic history and physical characteristics of this population suggest a role for multigenerational undernutrition in the aetiology of non-autoimmune diabetes in these young patients from Assam.",western world non autoimmune diabetes young believe drive overweight obesity insulin resistance increasingly report undernourished people middle income country include india hypothesise patient marker chronic undernutrition thin fat phenotype predominantly beta cell deficient study young patient clinically diagnose type diabete year attend outpatient department assam medical college hospital dibrugarh north east india measure weight height waist hip circumference haemoglobin fast glucose hba lipid gada c peptide level body fat percentage adiposity assess dual energy x ray absorptiometry calculate bmi kg m body roundness index homa index volunteer similar socioeconomic background normal glucose tolerance measure g ogtt assess control participant compare anthropometric characteristic body composition participant non hispanic white americans nhanes study study include control participant male participant median age year bmi kg m gada negative young patient diabetes male participant age year bmi kg m majority study participant come relatively impoverished population tea garden worker tribal worker patient diabetes stunt growth male cm female cm anaemic lean bmi kg m include underweight bmi kg m overweight obese bmi kg m assess dual energy x ray absorptiometry control participant patient adiposity body fat percentage male participant female participant compare contemporary non hispanic white american population assamese control participant diabetic patient high whr body roundness index total truncal adiposity assess dual energy x ray absorptiometry range bmi conform description thin fat phenotype diabetic patient severely beta cell deficient median homa b moderately insulin resistant median homa s high triacylglycerol low hdl cholesterol concentration control participant underweight patient kg m hyperglycaemic base fast plasma glucose hba severely beta cell deficient insulin sensitive previously report third patient belong severely insulin deficient diabetes sidd cluster accord swedish diabetes subgroup classification diabete young people impoverished population heterogeneous majority patient overweight obese insulin resistant overall participant conform thin fat phenotype diabetes predominantly drive beta cell deficiency sociodemographic history physical characteristic population suggest role multigenerational undernutrition aetiology non autoimmune diabetes young patient assam
"Prevalence and associated factors of pregnancy induced hypertension among pregnant women in public hospitals of Hadiya Zone, Central Ethiopia: A cross-sectional study.","Pregnancy-induced hypertension is one of the global public health burdens contributing to several adverse perinatal outcomes. However, data on the prevalence and associated factors of PIH is limited in Hadiya Zone, central Ethiopia. We conducted a cross-sectional study among women attending antenatal care in the four public hospitals in the Hadiya zone from August 1, 2023, to January 30, 2024. The total sample size (433) was proportionally allocated to each hospital. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. Blood pressure was measured by a digital Sphygmomanometer, and Pregnancy-induced hypertension status was considered if systolic blood pressure was ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg on two measurements among pregnant women with gestational age > 20 weeks. Factors associated with Pregnancy-induced hypertension were identified by multivariable binary logistic regression analysis, as expressed by adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and its 95% confidence interval. The mean age of the participants was 29.4 years (SD = ±4.6), and the majority of women were multiparous (59.6%). The prevalence of Pregnancy-induced hypertension was 13.4% (95% CI: 10.2% - 16.9%), of which 81% were preeclampsia. In the multivariable analysis, PIH was associated with, the poorest wealth index (aOR = 0.26, 95%CI: 0.08-0.90), having a family history of hypertension (aOR = 12.52,95%CI: 4.52-34.62), overweight maternal BMI (aOR = 4.24, 95%CI: 2.06-8.72), and gestational age (aOR = 0.21 at 95% CI: 0.06-0.82). More than 13 out of 100 pregnant women were found to have pregnancy-induced hypertension in the Hadiya zone, Southern Ethiopia. The high prevalence of Pregnancy-induced hypertension and its association with wealth index, gestational age, overweight/obesity and family history of hypertension/Pregnancy-induced hypertension underscores the need for targeted, tailored, and contextualized interventions to address Pregnancy-induced hypertension in the Hadiya zone.

"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Diabetes Mellitus: A Community-Based WHO STEPwise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS) Survey in Rural Haryana, India.","Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including type 2 diabetes mellitus, are emerging as major health concerns across India. Diabetes, once considered a predominantly urban condition, is increasingly being reported from rural populations as well, reflecting broader lifestyle and epidemiological transitions. National reports highlight a growing prevalence of high blood glucose levels, particularly among adults, with a rising trend in both awareness and disease burden. India is now among the countries with the highest number of individuals living with diabetes, necessitating urgent public health attention. This study examines the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors among adults in a rural area of Haryana, contributing to the evidence base required for targeted NCD prevention and control strategies in similar settings. The study was conducted among 910 adults aged ≥18 years from villages under the Primary Health Center (PHC) Garhi Harsaru, Haryana, India. Cluster random sampling, using probability proportional to size (PPS), was employed to recruit study participants. All the study participants were subjected to the WHO STEPS questionnaire, and random blood glucose estimation was done. Apart from these, demographic, socioeconomic, and anthropometric details, along with blood pressure and physical activity, were recorded, and their association with the prevalence of diabetes was studied. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 26.0 (Chicago, IL: IBM Corp.). Pearson's chi-squared test was used to evaluate differences between groups for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the independent associations.  The prevalence of newly detected diabetes was 6.2%. Adults aged 50-59 years (OR: 3.4), overweight, and obesity (OR: 5.80) were found to be the independent risk factors significantly associated with diabetes mellitus in the study population.  The prevalence of diabetes is rising, even in the rural population of Haryana. Targeted preventive strategies focusing on lifestyle modification and education should be prioritized in primary care settings to address this growing rural health challenge.",non communicable disease ncds include type diabetes mellitus emerge major health concern india diabetes consider predominantly urban condition increasingly report rural population reflect broad lifestyle epidemiological transition national report highlight grow prevalence high blood glucose level particularly adult rise trend awareness disease burden india country high number individual live diabetes necessitate urgent public health attention study examine prevalence type diabete associated risk factor adult rural area haryana contribute evidence base require target ncd prevention control strategy similar setting study conduct adult age year village primary health center phc garhi harsaru haryana india cluster random sampling probability proportional size pps employ recruit study participant study participant subject step questionnaire random blood glucose estimation apart demographic socioeconomic anthropometric detail blood pressure physical activity record association prevalence diabetes study statistical analysis spss version chicago il ibm corp pearson chi square test evaluate difference group categorical variable multivariate logistic regression examine independent association prevalence newly detect diabetes adult age year overweight obesity find independent risk factor significantly associate diabete mellitus study population prevalence diabetes rise rural population haryana target preventive strategy focus lifestyle modification education prioritize primary care setting address grow rural health challenge

Expert Consensus Statement on Simplified Glycemic Care in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"The growing burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in India, characterized by rising prevalence, complex treatment regimens, and substantial economic and psychological impact, necessitates a simplified, patient-centered approach to glycemic management. This expert consensus document presents evidence-based recommendations for streamlined glycemic care focused on enhancing treatment adherence, minimizing pill burden, and improving clinical outcomes. An expert panel of endocrinologists and diabetologists convened across eight advisory board meetings to review current evidence and generate practical strategies. Emphasis was placed on the early use of combination therapies, particularly sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, with or without metformin, tailored to individual patient profiles. The consensus underscores the importance of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) to improve adherence and cost-effectiveness. In addition to pharmacologic strategies, lifestyle interventions, including medical nutrition therapy, physical activity, and sleep hygiene, are advocated. Special considerations are provided for managing T2D with comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, emphasizing the pleiotropic benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. The recommendations also address barriers in the Indian healthcare landscape, including limited access to care and treatment inertia. This consensus aims to support clinicians, researchers, and policymakers in implementing an integrative, simplified care model that addresses the multifaceted challenges of T2D management in India. By adopting these recommendations, healthcare providers can enhance patient outcomes, reduce complications, and alleviate the socioeconomic burden of T2D.",grow burden type diabetes mellitus india characterize rise prevalence complex treatment regimen substantial economic psychological impact necessitate simplified patient center approach glycemic management expert consensus document present evidence base recommendation streamlined glycemic care focus enhance treatment adherence minimize pill burden improve clinical outcome expert panel endocrinologist diabetologist convene advisory board meeting review current evidence generate practical strategy emphasis place early use combination therapy particularly sodium glucose inhibitor dipeptidyl inhibitor metformin tailor individual patient profile consensus underscore importance fix dose combination fdcs improve adherence cost effectiveness addition pharmacologic strategy lifestyle intervention include medical nutrition therapy physical activity sleep hygiene advocate special consideration provide manage comorbid condition cardiovascular disease chronic kidney disease hypertension obesity dyslipidemia emphasize pleiotropic benefit inhibitor glucagon like receptor agonist recommendation address barrier indian healthcare landscape include limited access care treatment inertia consensus aim support clinician researcher policymaker implement integrative simplify care model address multifaceted challenge management india adopt recommendation healthcare provider enhance patient outcome reduce complication alleviate socioeconomic burden
Understanding the impact of urban exposure on obesity among middle and old-age migrants in India.,"Rural-to-urban migration is associated with elevated obesity in Western settings. However, whether migration to urban areas ages has any impact on obesity in India is inconclusive and scarce. We, therefore, assessed the impact of migration on obesity among rural-to-urban migrants and compared it with their rural counterparts. This study utilized the first wave of Longitudinal Ageing Study in India. BMI (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) and waist circumference (>102 cm and >88 cm for men and women, respectively) were employed to assess overall obesity and abdominal obesity. To fulfil the study objective, this study employed logistic and quantile regression techniques. The study found that individuals migrating from rural to urban areas are significantly more likely to develop obesity than rural stayers. Moreover, within the group of rural-urban migrants, prolonged urban residence was a strong and cumulative predictor for obesity. The risk of obesity was 1.91 times higher (those who lived 5 or fewer years in urban areas), 2.05 times higher (for 6-10 years), and 2.40 times higher (for more than 10 years) compared to their rural counterparts. This study identified migration and prolonged urban exposure as crucial risk factors for the development of obesity among middle-aged and older adults in India.",rural urban migration associate elevated obesity western setting migration urban area age impact obesity india inconclusive scarce assess impact migration obesity rural urban migrant compare rural counterpart study utilize wave longitudinal age study india bmi bmi kg waist circumference cm cm man woman respectively employ assess overall obesity abdominal obesity fulfil study objective study employ logistic quantile regression technique study find individual migrate rural urban area significantly likely develop obesity rural stayer group rural urban migrant prolonged urban residence strong cumulative predictor obesity risk obesity time high live few year urban area time high year time high year compare rural counterpart study identify migration prolonged urban exposure crucial risk factor development obesity middle aged old adult india
Understanding crosstalk between the gut and liver microbiome: pathogenesis to therapeutic approaches in liver cancer.,"HCC is the most common primary liver cancer, ranking as the sixth most prevalent cancer globally and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Etiological factors include:chronic liver diseases driven by alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, obesity, and metabolic disorders. Emerging evidence also suggests that gut microbiome alterations and subsequent immune and metabolic dysregulation contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of HCC. The gut-liver axis represents a dynamic interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, modulated by the gut microbiome, microbial metabolites, and immune responses. This bidirectional communication plays a pivotal role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and immune surveillance, while its dysregulation is implicated in various pathologies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gut microbiome, through microbial dysbiosis and metabolite secretion, significantly influences the tumor microenvironment and immune evasion mechanisms in HCC. Perturbations in gut barrier function and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation drive chronic inflammation, promoting tumor progression. Moreover, microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids, modulate inflammatory and metabolic pathways, offering novel insights into disease pathogenesis and potential biomarkers. Therapeutic strategies, including probiotics, prebiotics, and immune checkpoint inhibitors demonstrate promise in reprogramming the gut microbiome and restoring immune balance in HCC management. This review explores the multifaceted roles of the gut-liver axis in pathogenesis, the contributions of the intra-tumoral microbiome, and the potential of microbial metabolites as therapeutic avenues. A deeper understanding of these interactions could pave the way for innovative, targeted interventions in liver cancer and other gut-liver axis-associated diseases.",hcc common primary liver cancer rank sixth prevalent cancer globally lead cause cancer relate death etiological factor include chronic liver disease drive alcohol abuse viral hepatitis obesity metabolic disorder emerge evidence suggest gut microbiome alteration subsequent immune metabolic dysregulation contribute pathogenesis progression hcc gut liver axis represent dynamic interplay gastrointestinal tract liver modulate gut microbiome microbial metabolite immune response bidirectional communication play pivotal role maintain metabolic homeostasis immune surveillance dysregulation implicate pathology include hepatocellular carcinoma hcc gut microbiome microbial dysbiosis metabolite secretion significantly influence tumor microenvironment immune evasion mechanism hcc perturbation gut barrier function toll like receptor activation drive chronic inflammation promote tumor progression microbial metabolite short chain fatty acid scfas bile acid modulate inflammatory metabolic pathway offer novel insight disease pathogenesis potential biomarker therapeutic strategy include probiotic prebiotic immune checkpoint inhibitor demonstrate promise reprogramme gut microbiome restore immune balance hcc management review explore multifaceted role gut liver axis pathogenesis contribution intra tumoral microbiome potential microbial metabolite therapeutic avenue deep understanding interaction pave way innovative target intervention liver cancer gut liver axis associate disease
Obesity and Overweight-Practical Management for Indian Setting.,"Overweight and obesity are showing an alarmingly increased prevalence around the world. The increase in prevalence is seen across all ages. NFHS-5 data has demonstrated a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among both children and adults in India with a proportionate increase in the risk for metabolic complications. Presence of overweight and obesity has been associated with several metabolic dysfunctions including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardio-metabolic disorders, and menstrual & fertility disorders. Children whose BMI is high in childhood demonstrate features suggestive of cardio-metabolic dysfunction. Growth charts pertaining to BMI charts and abdominal circumference along with clinical examination continue to play an important role in evaluation of obesity. Investigations are tailored to each individual based on clinical picture and evaluation of specific complication. Lifestyle modifications, at the earliest, with adequate sleep, sufficient exercise as suited for the age and individual, and sensible food intake help in averting long term complications. Several new drugs are available for older children. But, these are to be used judiciously based on current health, associated complications, and with the full concurrence of the family after a reasonable amount of lifestyle measures.",overweight obesity show alarmingly increase prevalence world increase prevalence see age datum demonstrate significant increase prevalence overweight obesity child adult india proportionate increase risk metabolic complication presence overweight obesity associate metabolic dysfunction include type diabetes mellitus cardio metabolic disorder menstrual fertility disorder child bmi high childhood demonstrate feature suggestive cardio metabolic dysfunction growth chart pertain bmi chart abdominal circumference clinical examination continue play important role evaluation obesity investigation tailor individual base clinical picture evaluation specific complication lifestyle modification early adequate sleep sufficient exercise suit age individual sensible food intake help avert long term complication new drug available old child judiciously base current health associate complication concurrence family reasonable lifestyle measure
"Immigration, acculturation, and diabetes: A comparative study of diabetes prevalence among Asian Indian immigrants living in the United States and native-born populations in India and the United States.","Despite evidence that Indian immigrants in high-income countries have higher diabetes risk, few studies have directly compared Indian immigrants to both Indians in India and the general population. We compared diabetes prevalence in the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) study (Indian immigrants) (N = 686), the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) (Indians in India) (N = 40,496), and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (general US population) (N = 7643), accounting for selective immigration using propensity score matching. We used generalized regression models to assess associations between diabetes and acculturation in MASALA and compare correlates of diabetes across studies. After matching, Indians in India had a higher prevalence of diabetes (37.9 % [35.4-40.5]) than Indian immigrants in the US (26.7 % [23.5-30.1]) and the general US population (19.6 % [17.6-21.8]). Higher acculturation was associated with a lower diabetes prevalence (prevalence ratio [PR]: 0.68 [0.45-1.04], <i>P</i> = 0.078) and lower HbA1c (difference: 0.205 % [-0.408 to -0.001], <i>P</i> = 0.049). We also identified differences in the magnitude of correlations between diabetes and risk factors, including abdominal obesity (MASALA PR: 1.41 [1.09-1.81], LASI PR: 2.41 [2.29-2.54], HRS PR: 2.52 [2.17-2.93]).

"Quantification of regional variation in ultra-processed food consumption and its sociodemographic correlates across Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka: insights from the South Asia Biobank.","Sales of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are rising in South Asia, yet UPF consumption and its sociodemographic determinants remain largely unknown. We aimed to quantify UPF consumption and investigate its sociodemographic correlates in four countries of South Asia. Between January 2020 and September 2022, the South Asia Biobank recruited 63,914 participants aged 18 years or older who were resident in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and North and South India, and self-reported as being of South Asian ethnicity. We analysed data from 60,714 eligible adults. Dietary consumption was assessed using interviewer-led 24-h recalls. Foods were classified by their degree of processing using the NOVA classification. Two-part multivariable-adjusted regression models examined associations of sociodemographic factors with the likelihood and quantity of UPF consumption. In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and North India, ∼75% of participants reported consuming UPFs during the previous day, versus 41% in South India and Pakistan. Among consumers, UPFs contributed 13-17% of total energy intake, with biscuits being a common source across regions. Other UPFs included sweetened beverages in Pakistan, packaged salty snacks in South India, and breakfast cereals in Bangladesh. Younger age was associated with UPF consumption in Pakistan and Sri Lanka whereas in Bangladesh and North India, older age was. Women were more likely to consume UPFs in all regions except Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and North India, any level of education above none (i.e., primary, secondary, or higher) was associated with UPF consumption. Among consumers, UPF consumption was lower in married or cohabiting than single people, in all regions. UPF consumption was higher in rural versus urban residents in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka but lower in Pakistan.

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its association to modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular disease among apparently healthy adults in Central Kerala.,"Cardiovascular diseases remain one of the leading causes of mortality globally with 80% occurring in developing countries. The known modifiable cardiovascular risk factors are Hypertension, Diabetes, Obesity, Hyperlipidaemia, Smoking, and Sedentary lifestyles. The prevalence of these risk factors is highest in Kerala (hypertension 30% and diabetes 14.8%). Globally India has the highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease especially in Kerala. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency nationally is about 70-100% in some studies but shows contradictory results in various populations in Kerala (children 11% and 89% in perimenopause women). No Known study was done among apparently healthy adults in Kerala. Hence understanding its prevalence and its association if any to the cardiovascular risk factors may help to decrease the prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Subjects were taken from those who attended the health check-up at a tertiary hospital. Blood parameters like FBS, Triglyceride, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), and Serum Vitamin D were analyzed along with Blood pressure and waist circumference. Frequency and Chi-squared test was done to look for prevalence and association of the various cardiovascular risk factors and vitamin D prevalence using IBM SPSS version 20.0 software. It was found that Hypertension was highly prevalent (75%) among the cardiovascular risk factors. The prevalence of deficient and insufficient Vitamin D was 86.9% and it was significantly associated with Hypertension (<i>p</i> = <.001), Diabetes (<i>p</i> = <.001), High Triglycerides (<i>p</i> = <.001), and Low (at risk) High-density Lipoprotein (<i>p</i> = <.001) but not to obesity (<i>P</i> = 1.00).

"The relationship between hypertension, anemia, and BMI in women of reproductive age: evidence from a nationwide health study.","Hypertension, anemia, and malnutrition are significant global health challenges. While prior studies have primarily focused on the prevalence of these conditions in Nepal, no research has investigated the interrelationship among them. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association of hypertension with anemia, blood hemoglobin levels, and body mass index (BMI) among women of reproductive age. Using multilevel logistic regression models, we analyzed nationally representative data from the 2022 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). A total of 4,133 eligible women aged 15-49 were included in this study. Hypertension (systolic pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), anemia (blood hemoglobin < 12 g/dl), and BMI categories were defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. Student's t-test, Pearson's Chi-square, and linear regression analysis were performed in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 29.78 ± 9.61 years. The prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in women without anemia than those with anemia (9.0% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001). An inverse association was observed between hypertension and anemia (OR, 0.73; 95% CI: 0.55-0.96; p < 0.01). Increased hemoglobin levels (systolic: β, 1.24; 95% CI: 0.14-1.46; diastolic: β = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.38-1.71) and BMI (systolic: β = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80-0.99; diastolic: β = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.68-0.92) were positively correlated with hypertension. Smoking, overweight, obesity, and increased mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) were found to increase the risk of hypertension. This study demonstrates a positive association between hypertension and BMI, while anemia was linked to a lower risk of hypertension. The findings suggest that higher hemoglobin levels may serve as an independent risk factor for hypertension. Therefore, regular screening of hemoglobin levels and BMI, along with interventions addressing dietary and lifestyle factors is recommended to mitigate the risk of hypertension.",hypertension anemia malnutrition significant global health challenge prior study primarily focus prevalence condition nepal research investigate interrelationship study aim investigate association hypertension anemia blood hemoglobin level body mass index bmi woman reproductive age multilevel logistic regression model analyze nationally representative datum nepal demographic health survey ndhs total eligible woman age include study hypertension systolic pressure mmhg diastolic pressure mmhg anemia blood hemoglobin g dl bmi category define accord world health organization guideline student t test pearson chi square linear regression analysis perform analysis mean age participant year prevalence hypertension significantly high woman anemia anemia p inverse association observe hypertension anemia ci p increase hemoglobin level systolic β ci diastolic β ci bmi systolic β ci diastolic β ci positively correlate hypertension smoking overweight obesity increase mid upper arm circumference muac find increase risk hypertension study demonstrate positive association hypertension bmi anemia link low risk hypertension finding suggest high hemoglobin level serve independent risk factor hypertension regular screening hemoglobin level bmi intervention address dietary lifestyle factor recommend mitigate risk hypertension
Lean diabetes is one end of the spectrum of type 2 diabetes and not a separate entity.,"Lean diabetes mellitus is non-type 1 diabetes with BMI < 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and is now proposed to be a unique form of diabetes. We report on prevalence, clinical and microvascular complication profile in lean diabetes to see whether it stands out as a distinct entity or is a continuum of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using electronic records of a tertiary care diabetes centre in South India, individuals with T2D(n = 398,258) were classified using BMI, as lean(<18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), normal weight(18.5-22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>),overweight(23.0-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>),mildly obese(25.0-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and markedly obese(≥30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) T2D. Clinical and biochemical features as well as frequency of microvascular complications of lean diabetes were compared with other T2D groups. The prevalence of lean diabetes was 1.5 %(n = 5865). Lean diabetes were younger with male preponderance, had higher fasting, postprandial plasma glucose, HbA1c levels, lower C-peptide and serum cholesterol compared to normal weight, overweight and obese T2D. Lean T2D had higher prevalence of retinopathy (42%), nephropathy (39 %), and neuropathy (73 %) compared to other groups(p < 0.001). Additionally, lean T2D were more likely to be treated with insulin (55.6 %, p < 0.001) compared with other groups.

Predictors of gestational weight gain in western India: Findings from a longitudinal study across rural and urban cohorts.,"Gestational weight gain-GWG is an important predictor of neonatal growth. However, there is dearth of literature from rural and urban India depicting longitudinal patterns and determinants of GWG. To address this gap, our objectives were to study longitudinal patterns and predictors of GWG in pregnant women residing in rural and urban areas in and around Pune city, Maharashtra, India and to compare them with pre-existing guidelines provided by IOM, 2009. This study enrolled 268(134-rural and 134-urban) healthy singleton pregnant women attending antenatal care centers in and around Pune, India between August 2020-September 2023. Participants were measured for anthropometry and interviewed for socioeconomic status, diet, physical activity, sleep quality, and prenatal distress once in each trimester. Pre-gestational weight status was calculated using WHO, Asian-Pacific, and South Asian BMI cut-points. GWG was estimated using IOM, 2009 guidelines. The observed mean GWG was 10.9 ± 4.2 kg(rural:9.9 ± 3.7, urban:11.9 ± 4.5). 61.2% of rural and 30% of urban underweight pregnant women did not gain adequate weight. 11.8% of rural and 57.3% of urban pregnant women with overweight or obese BMI exceeded recommended guideliness. Key predictors of inadequate GWG in second and third trimesters were low socio-economic status, parity, underweight pre-gestational BMI, prenatal distress, and poor sleep. The primary predictor of excessive GWG was overweight or obese pre-gestational BMI. These findings were consistent across all BMI classifications. Our findings indicate that urban underweight pregnant women gained significantly higher weight. There was health disparity between rural and urban pregnant women that needs to be addressed to improve health of pregnant women. We have identified important modifiable factors such as dietary intake, physical activity, etc. to ensure optimal GWG which can inform public health policies. Further research is needed to assess whether context-specific GWG recommendations would be beneficial as our study is based on single geographical location and timeframe.",gestational weight gain gwg important predictor neonatal growth dearth literature rural urban india depict longitudinal pattern determinant gwg address gap objective study longitudinal pattern predictor gwg pregnant woman reside rural urban area pune city maharashtra india compare pre exist guideline provide iom study enrol rural urban healthy singleton pregnant woman attend antenatal care center pune india august september participant measure anthropometry interview socioeconomic status diet physical activity sleep quality prenatal distress trimester pre gestational weight status calculate asian pacific south asian bmi cut point gwg estimate iom guideline observed mean gwg rural urban underweight pregnant woman gain adequate weight rural urban pregnant woman overweight obese bmi exceed recommend guideliness key predictor inadequate gwg second trimester low socio economic status parity underweight pre gestational bmi prenatal distress poor sleep primary predictor excessive gwg overweight obese pre gestational bmi finding consistent bmi classification finding indicate urban underweight pregnant woman gain significantly high weight health disparity rural urban pregnant woman need address improve health pregnant woman identify important modifiable factor dietary intake physical activity etc ensure optimal gwg inform public health policy research need assess context specific gwg recommendation beneficial study base single geographical location timeframe
Association between dynapenic abdominal obesity and mild cognitive impairment among middle-aged and older community-dwelling adults.,"Dynapenic abdominal obesity (DAO) may potentially increase risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but data is scarce, and community-based studies are lacking. Thus, we aimed to investigate the association between DAO and MCI in a large nationally representative community-based sample from six LMICs (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa). We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health. Dynapenia was defined as handgrip strength of < 26 kg for men and < 16 kg for women. Abdominal obesity was defined as waist circumference of > 88 cm for women and > 102 cm for men. DAO was defined as having both dynapenia and abdominal obesity. The National Institute on Ageing-Alzheimer's Association criteria were used to define MCI. Multivariable logistic regression was performed. Data on 32,715 individuals aged ≥ 50 years were analyzed [mean (SD) age 62.1 (15.6) years; 48.3% males]. Among those aged 50-64 years, dynapenia alone and DAO were significantly associated with MCI with the OR for DAO (OR = 1.79; 95%CI = 1.26-2.56) being higher than that of dynapenia alone (OR = 1.40; 95%CI = 1.15-1.71). In those aged ≥ 65 years, only dynapenia alone (OR = 1.53; 95%CI = 1.23-1.89) was significantly associated with MCI but not DAO. Abdominal obesity alone was not significantly associated with MCI in both age groups. Among community-dwellers in six LMICs, DAO was significantly associated with MCI among middle-aged individuals, but not among older people. However, it is important to note that the study was cross-sectional in nature, and thus, it is not known whether DAO leads to MCI or vice versa. Therefore, future longitudinal studies are necessary to clarify temporal associations and possible causality.",dynapenic abdominal obesity dao potentially increase risk mild cognitive impairment mci datum scarce community base study lack aim investigate association dao mci large nationally representative community base sample lmic china ghana india mexico russia south africa analyze cross sectional datum study global ageing adult health dynapenia define handgrip strength kg man kg woman abdominal obesity define waist circumference cm woman cm man dao define have dynapenia abdominal obesity national institute age alzheimer association criterion define mci multivariable logistic regression perform datum individual age year analyze mean sd age year male age year dynapenia dao significantly associate mci dao high dynapenia age year dynapenia significantly associate mci dao abdominal obesity significantly associate mci age group community dweller lmic dao significantly associate mci middle aged individual old people important note study cross sectional nature know dao lead mci vice versa future longitudinal study necessary clarify temporal association possible causality
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Assessment Among University Employees in India and Its Implications on Planning Worksite CVD Prevention and Health Promotion Interventions.,"University employees worldwide have a relatively higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. However, in the Indian context, most University employees are not regularly screened for CVD risk factors. Against this background, a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of hypertension and CVD risk factors among Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Solapur University employees in India. This cross-sectional study included the university's teaching, administrative, and support staff (n=126). Data on physiological, anthropometric, worksite, and sociodemographic variables were collected using the WHO Stepwise approach to noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factor surveillance (STEPS) questionnaire. The chi-square/Fisher's exact test was used to test the association of employees' sociodemographics, work-related addictions, diet intake, exercise, and health-related characteristics with CVD risk. The univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis assessed the factors associated with CVD risk. The prevalence of hypertension was found to be 42%. There was a clustering of NCD risk factors (≥ 3 risk factors) in 88% (n=111) of employees. Overweight and obesity were the most prominent risk factors identified in 64% (n=81) of the employees, followed by family history of CVDs (62%, n=78), unhealthy dietary habits (61%, n=77), abdominal obesity (45%, n=57), and raised blood pressure (42%, n=53). Further, men's gender, age of more than 40 years, family structure, consumption of alcohol, smoking, higher monthly income, and academic and regular employment were the risk factors significantly associated with future CVD development risk. University employees are prone to developing CVDs, and urgent attention is needed to develop worksite CVD prevention and health promotion interventions.",university employee worldwide relatively high prevalence cardiovascular disease cvd risk factor indian context university employee regularly screen cvd risk factor background cross sectional study conduct determine prevalence hypertension cvd risk factor punyashlok ahilyadevi holkar solapur university employee india cross sectional study include university teaching administrative support staff datum physiological anthropometric worksite sociodemographic variable collect stepwise approach noncommunicable disease ncd risk factor surveillance step questionnaire chi square fisher exact test test association employee sociodemographic work relate addiction diet intake exercise health relate characteristic cvd risk univariate multivariable logistic regression analysis assess factor associate cvd risk prevalence hypertension find clustering ncd risk factor risk factor employee overweight obesity prominent risk factor identify employee follow family history cvds unhealthy dietary habit abdominal obesity raise blood pressure man gender age year family structure consumption alcohol smoking high monthly income academic regular employment risk factor significantly associate future cvd development risk university employee prone develop cvds urgent attention need develop worksite cvd prevention health promotion intervention
Spousal Concordance in Overweight and Obesity among Indian Couples: A Nationwide Analysis of Socioeconomic and Dietary Determinants.,"This study examines the level and determinants of spousal concordance in overweight/obesity among married couples in India. The rising prevalence of overweight/obesity is a growing public health concern globally. While spousal concordance in obesity is recognized in developed countries, less is known about this phenomenon in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding the shared risk factors within couples is crucial for effective intervention. We analyzed data from 52,737 married couples using the nationally representative National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 (2019-2021). This study used the Asian body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) cutoff for overweight/obesity (≥23.0) concordance. Descriptive statistics were used to assess sociodemographic characteristics. The log-binomial regression model was used to estimate the adjusted risk ratio (ARR) of spousal concordance in overweight/obesity. Overall, 27.4% of couples exhibited concordance for overweight or obesity. Concordance was more prevalent among couples belonging to the richest wealth quintile (47.6%), residing in urban areas (38.4%), living in nuclear families (28.9%), sharing similar age (28.8%) or higher (28.9%), or having similar education levels (31.4%). Higher concordance was also associated with couples not engaged in paid work (33.9%) and those who frequently used media (newspapers: 39.6%, television: 32.8%) or consumed nonvegetarian foods weekly-eggs (30.7%), chicken (29.9%). Geographically, the highest concordance was observed in the southern (37.2%) and northern (33.5%) regions, with Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Delhi, Goa, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab reporting the highest state-level prevalence (≥42%). Multivariable analysis showed significantly increased risk of spousal overweight/obesity concordance among couples in the richest wealth quintile (ARR = 4.311; 95% CI: 3.757, 4.947), urban areas (ARR = 1.085; 95% CI: 1.016, 1.159), other religious groups (ARR = 1.185; 95% CI: 1.089, 1.291). Regular consumption of eggs (14%), fish (25%), chicken (9%), fried foods (6%), and alcohol (98%) were also linked to higher concordance. Spousal concordance in overweight/obesity is strongly influenced by shared socioeconomic status, lifestyle behaviors, and dietary patterns. Couples in urban, affluent, media-exposed, and nonvegetarian households are particularly at risk. Public health strategies should prioritize couple-based interventions, especially among high-risk subgroups, to curb the dual burden of overweight/obesity and associated chronic diseases.",study examine level determinant spousal concordance overweight obesity married couple india rise prevalence overweight obesity grow public health concern globally spousal concordance obesity recognize develop country know phenomenon middle income country understand share risk factor couple crucial effective intervention analyze datum married couple nationally representative national family health survey study asian body mass index bmi kg m cutoff overweight obesity concordance descriptive statistic assess sociodemographic characteristic log binomial regression model estimate adjusted risk ratio arr spousal concordance overweight obesity overall couple exhibit concordance overweight obesity concordance prevalent couple belong rich wealth quintile reside urban area live nuclear family share similar age high have similar education level high concordance associate couple engage pay work frequently medium newspaper television consume nonvegetarian food weekly egg chicken geographically high concordance observe southern northern region kerala jammu kashmir manipur delhi goa tamil nadu punjab report high state level prevalence multivariable analysis show significantly increase risk spousal overweight obesity concordance couple rich wealth quintile arr ci urban area arr ci religious group arr ci regular consumption egg fish chicken fried food alcohol link high concordance spousal concordance overweight obesity strongly influence share socioeconomic status lifestyle behavior dietary pattern couple urban affluent media expose nonvegetarian household particularly risk public health strategy prioritize couple base intervention especially high risk subgroup curb dual burden overweight obesity associated chronic disease
Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and nutritional deficiency: A comprehensive longitudinal analysis.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) represents a cornerstone in the surgical management of morbid obesity. While the procedure effectively reduces weight and improves obesity-related comorbidities, the anatomical alterations inherent to LSG can lead to significant nutritional challenges. These modifications in gastrointestinal physiology may result in various micronutrient deficiencies, particularly affecting iron, Vitamin B12 and folate status. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 70 patients undergoing LSG at our tertiary care centre. Participants underwent comprehensive nutritional assessment at baseline and regular intervals postoperatively (6, 12 and 24 months). We measured serum levels of key micronutrients, including iron, Vitamin B12 and folate, while simultaneously tracking supplement adherence. Statistical analysis incorporated both univariate and multivariate approaches to identify patterns and risk factors for nutritional deficiencies. Our analysis revealed distinct gender-specific patterns in nutritional deficiencies. Female patients demonstrated significantly higher rates of iron deficiency throughout the study period, with prevalence rates of 58%, 50% and 36% at 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Vitamin B12 deficiency showed a progressive increase in both genders, while supplement adherence declined markedly from 96% at 6 months to 42% at 24 months. Multivariate analysis identified female gender, younger age and poor supplement adherence as significant risk factors for nutritional deficiencies. Post-LSG nutritional deficiencies present a significant clinical challenge, particularly for female patients. Our findings emphasise the critical importance of long-term nutritional monitoring and the need for targeted supplementation and adherence-enhancing intervention strategies to improve supplement adherence.",laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy lsg represent cornerstone surgical management morbid obesity procedure effectively reduce weight improve obesity relate comorbiditie anatomical alteration inherent lsg lead significant nutritional challenge modification gastrointestinal physiology result micronutrient deficiency particularly affect iron vitamin folate status conduct prospective cohort study patient undergo lsg tertiary care centre participant undergo comprehensive nutritional assessment baseline regular interval postoperatively month measure serum level key micronutrient include iron vitamin folate simultaneously track supplement adherence statistical analysis incorporate univariate multivariate approach identify pattern risk factor nutritional deficiency analysis reveal distinct gender specific pattern nutritional deficiency female patient demonstrate significantly high rate iron deficiency study period prevalence rate month respectively vitamin deficiency show progressive increase gender supplement adherence decline markedly month month multivariate analysis identify female gender young age poor supplement adherence significant risk factor nutritional deficiency post lsg nutritional deficiency present significant clinical challenge particularly female patient finding emphasise critical importance long term nutritional monitoring need target supplementation adherence enhance intervention strategy improve supplement adherence
Polygenic prediction of body mass index and obesity through the life course and across ancestries.,"Polygenic scores (PGSs) for body mass index (BMI) may guide early prevention and targeted treatment of obesity. Using genetic data from up to 5.1 million people (4.6% African ancestry, 14.4% American ancestry, 8.4% East Asian ancestry, 71.1% European ancestry and 1.5% South Asian ancestry) from the GIANT consortium and 23andMe, Inc., we developed ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs. The multi-ancestry score explained 17.6% of BMI variation among UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. For other populations, this ranged from 16% in East Asian-Americans to 2.2% in rural Ugandans. In the ALSPAC study, children with higher PGSs showed accelerated BMI gain from age 2.5 years to adolescence, with earlier adiposity rebound. Adding the PGS to predictors available at birth nearly doubled explained variance for BMI from age 5 onward (for example, from 11% to 21% at age 8). Up to age 5, adding the PGS to early-life BMI improved prediction of BMI at age 18 (for example, from 22% to 35% at age 5). Higher PGSs were associated with greater adult weight gain. In intensive lifestyle intervention trials, individuals with higher PGSs lost modestly more weight in the first year (0.55 kg per s.d.) but were more likely to regain it. Overall, these data show that PGSs have the potential to improve obesity prediction, particularly when implemented early in life.",polygenic score pgss body mass index bmi guide early prevention target treatment obesity genetic datum million people african ancestry american ancestry east asian ancestry european ancestry south asian ancestry giant consortium inc develop ancestry specific multi ancestry pgss multi ancestry score explain bmi variation uk biobank participant european ancestry population range east asian americans rural ugandan alspac study child high pgss showed accelerate bmi gain age year adolescence early adiposity rebound add pgs predictor available birth nearly double explain variance bmi age onward example age age add pgs early life bmi improve prediction bmi age example age high pgss associate great adult weight gain intensive lifestyle intervention trial individual high pgss lose modestly weight year kg likely regain overall datum pgss potential improve obesity prediction particularly implement early life
"Human Metapneumovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Influenza Associated Pneumonia Hospitalizations in Colorado Adults Aged Over 50 Years: 2016-2023.","The objectives were to identify the frequency and risk factors for ICU admission and mortality associated with RSV, influenza, and HMPV pneumonia hospitalizations and to compare these rates with those admitted with other ARI caused by these viruses. This retrospective cohort study identified hospitalization encounters of adults' aged 50 to 88 years with RSV, influenza and HMPV pneumonia between 2016 and 2023 in the Colorado Hospital Association database., . Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds of ICU admission and mortality. Of 2210 hospitalized patients with RSV pneumonia, 780 (35%) were admitted to the ICU and 205 (9.3%) died. For Influenza pneumonia these figures were 7174, 2332 (32.5%) and 545 (7.6%) and HMPV pneumonia 1482, 408 (27.5%) and 88 (5.9%) respectively. Dementia has the highest odds for ICU admission in patients with RSV pneumonia aOR 4.2 (1.34, 13.18), for influenza pneumonia it was chronic pulmonary disease aOR 2.99 (2.45, 3.66) and for HMPV pneumonia it was COPD without asthma aOR 5.04 (2.92, 8.7). Increasing age was associated with increasing rates of mortality for RSV and influenza. Chronic pulmonary disease, and COPD itself had > 2 fold higher rates of mortality in patients with pneumonia for all three viruses while obesity, , diabetes and chronic renal disease didn't.

"Prevalence of Medical Disorders During Pregnancy in India: A Comprehensive Observational Study to Assess the Prevalence of Hypertension, Diabetes, and Thyroid Disorders During Pregnancy in Indian Women.","Background Pregnancy is a critical period where maternal non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and thyroid dysfunction significantly affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of these conditions among pregnant women in India. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at a tertiary care hospital. The participants were enrolled irrespective of gestational age. Known cases of pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disorders were excluded. Data were collected via structured questionnaires and clinical records, capturing demographics, obstetric history, lifestyle, diagnostic values, and the awareness of risk factors. Conditions were diagnosed based on standardized criteria (Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India {DIPSI} for GDM, blood pressure {BP} of ≥140/90 mmHg for hypertension, and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone {TSH} levels for thyroid dysfunction). Results The prevalence of GDM, hypertension, and thyroid dysfunction was 60 (20%), 48 (16%), and 36 (12%), respectively. GDM and hypertension were significantly more common in urban participants (p<0.05), and both were associated with higher body mass index (BMI). Thyroid dysfunction was frequently diagnosed in the first trimester (22, 61.1%). A significant upward trend in all three disorders was observed with increasing BMI. The awareness of risk factors was higher among educated women, correlating with earlier diagnosis. Conclusion This study highlights a substantial burden of NCDs among pregnant women, especially GDM and hypertension. Urbanization, obesity, and maternal age were key contributing factors. While structured screening and early antenatal registration are existing mandates, our findings underscore the need for targeted and scalable interventions beyond current protocols.",background pregnancy critical period maternal non communicable disease ncds hypertensive disorder gestational diabetes mellitus gdm thyroid dysfunction significantly affect maternal fetal outcome study aim determine prevalence associate factor condition pregnant woman india method cross sectional study conduct pregnant woman attend antenatal clinic tertiary care hospital participant enrol irrespective gestational age know case pre existing hypertension diabetes thyroid disorder exclude datum collect structured questionnaire clinical record capture demographic obstetric history lifestyle diagnostic value awareness risk factor condition diagnose base standardized criterion diabete pregnancy study group india dipsi gdm blood pressure bp mmhg hypertension trimester specific thyroid stimulate hormone tsh level thyroid dysfunction result prevalence gdm hypertension thyroid dysfunction respectively gdm hypertension significantly common urban participant associate high body mass index bmi thyroid dysfunction frequently diagnose trimester significant upward trend disorder observe increase bmi awareness risk factor high educate woman correlate early diagnosis conclusion study highlight substantial burden ncds pregnant woman especially gdm hypertension urbanization obesity maternal age key contributing factor structured screening early antenatal registration exist mandate finding underscore need targeted scalable intervention current protocol
Early Universal Screening with a Combination of Fasting Plasma Glucose and Glycated Haemoglobin is the Best Community Screening Strategy for Dysglycaemia in Indian Youth.,"Any intervention to reduce the incidence of diabetes needs to target the young population at the stage of early insulin resistance or prediabetes. There are no screening guidelines for dysglycaemia in non-obese youth. This study was designed to find the best screening investigation for dysglycaemia in community-dwelling youth. Using multistage sampling, community-dwelling non-obese subjects aged 18-30 years were assessed for diabetes using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT], fasting plasma glucose [FPG] and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at a health facility near the participants' home. Diagnosis of dysglycaemia (diabetes and prediabetes) was made based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. A total of 2540 participants from 74 family welfare centres with a mean age of 24.2 ± 3.5 years and 1292 female (50.8%) participants were included. Urban, rural, coastal and hilly regions contributed 661 (26%), 580 (22.8%), 656 (25.8%) and 643 (25.3%) participants, respectively, and 88.4% of participants came from the middle or lower middle class. Diabetes was detected in 59 (2.3%) and prediabetes in 568 (22.4%) of these young participants. The sensitivity of HbA1c with FPG in diagnosing diabetes mellitus (DM) and prediabetes was 87.87%, whereas the sensitivity of FPG and 2-h OGTT together was 44.2% (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The prevalence of dysglycaemia in non-obese Indian youth is alarmingly high. There is an urgent need to define screening strategies for dysglycaemia in this population. Based on this study, universal screening for dysglycaemia using HbA1c and FPG in early adulthood is recommended.",intervention reduce incidence diabetes need target young population stage early insulin resistance prediabete screening guideline dysglycaemia non obese youth study design find good screening investigation dysglycaemia community dwell youth multistage sampling community dwell non obese subject age year assess diabete g oral glucose tolerance test ogtt fast plasma glucose fpg glycate haemoglobin health facility near participant home diagnosis dysglycaemia diabete prediabete base american diabetes association ada criterion total participant family welfare centre mean age year female participant include urban rural coastal hilly region contribute participant respectively participant come middle low middle class diabetes detect prediabete young participant sensitivity fpg diagnose diabete mellitus dm prediabete sensitivity fpg h ogtt prevalence dysglycaemia non obese indian youth alarmingly high urgent need define screening strategy dysglycaemia population base study universal screening dysglycaemia fpg early adulthood recommend
Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Obesity.,"The prevalence of obesity has increased significantly in the last few years. Addressing obesity needs multifaceted strategy including prevention, accurate diagnosis, treatment of secondary causes, diet and exercise, behavioral changes and long term management. In addition it involves integration of multiple teams including endocrinologist, respiratory medicine, ENT, psychiatry, physiotherapy, diet, and bariatric surgeon. Artificial intelligence can help with each of these aspects by enabling predictive analysis, behavioral intervention in real time and improving patient outcome. There are certain challenges in integrating AI with patient management including ensuring data privacy and mitigating algorithm bias. But overall, it represents a promising tool to empower both the individual and the physician treating obesity.",prevalence obesity increase significantly year address obesity need multifaceted strategy include prevention accurate diagnosis treatment secondary cause diet exercise behavioral change long term management addition involve integration multiple team include endocrinologist respiratory medicine ent psychiatry physiotherapy diet bariatric surgeon artificial intelligence help aspect enable predictive analysis behavioral intervention real time improve patient outcome certain challenge integrate ai patient management include ensure datum privacy mitigate algorithm bias overall represent promising tool empower individual physician treat obesity
Interventions to lower cardiovascular disease risk factors among Asian Indian immigrants: a scoping review protocol.,"To identify effective interventions to lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among Asian Indian (AI) immigrants.As the second largest immigrant group in the USA, AI immigrants experience CVD prevalence rates as high as 13% among males and 4.4% among females; these rates are significantly higher than other Asian subgroups and the general US population. Despite extensive knowledge of CVD risk factors, there have been few cardioprotective interventions in this population. Interventional studies of first-generation AI immigrants aged 18-70 years, conducted between 2000 and 2025, will be identified, including randomised controlled trials, factorial and cross-over designs, and cluster randomised trials. We will include AIs with and without a specific family history of CVD, or personal history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia or obesity. Exclusion criteria include AIs born in the USA or visiting.The Arksey and O'Malley methodology framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews will be used for analysis. A preliminary review of interventions to lower the CVD risk in AIs will guide the research questions (stage 1). Relevant articles published between 2000 and 2025 will be retrieved using electronic databases and search terms (stage 2). Two independent reviewers will select studies based on eligibility criteria (stage 3). Reviewers will determine eligibility status, screen full texts and retrieve relevant publications. Reviewers will extract data, capturing study design, sample characteristics, types of interventions, outcomes and key findings (stage 4). A summary of results will be presented (stage 5). The review will identify the most effective interventions, potential areas for future research and practical recommendations to improve CVD outcomes among AI immigrants. Included studies will meet ethical standards in research. Findings will be disseminated through manuscripts, presentations at relevant conferences and community outreach programmes to promote effective interventions.",identify effective intervention lower cardiovascular disease cvd risk factor asian indian ai second large immigrant group usa ai immigrant experience cvd prevalence rate high male female rate significantly high asian subgroup general population despite extensive knowledge cvd risk factor cardioprotective intervention population interventional study generation ai immigrant age year conduct identify include randomise control trial factorial cross design cluster randomise trial include ais specific family history cvd personal history type diabete mellitus hyperlipidaemia obesity exclusion criterion include ais bear usa arksey methodology framework preferred reporting item systematic review meta analysis extension scope review analysis preliminary review intervention lower cvd risk ais guide research question stage relevant article publish retrieve electronic database search term stage independent reviewer select study base eligibility criterion stage reviewer determine eligibility status screen text retrieve relevant publication reviewer extract datum capture study design sample characteristic type intervention outcome key finding stage summary result present stage review identify effective intervention potential area future research practical recommendation improve cvd outcome ai immigrant include study meet ethical standard research finding disseminate manuscript presentation relevant conference community outreach programme promote effective intervention
"Asthma: epidemiology, risk factors, and opportunities for prevention and treatment.","Asthma is characterised by variable airflow obstruction and is associated with symptoms of cough, wheeze, and dyspnoea, and with airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. There are approximately 300 million people with asthma worldwide. Despite a current plateau, the burden of this disease is likely to increase due to population growth, urbanisation, and ageing. Disease onset is associated with low birthweight, preterm birth, viral infections, in-utero passive smoke exposure, urbanisation, and occupational exposures. Obesity is associated with increased incidence and severity of asthma, whereas exposure to small allergen particles leads to severe disease. In adults and adolescents, inhaled corticosteroids in combination with formoterol (as anti-inflammatory reliever or as maintenance and anti-inflammatory reliever therapy) are widely recommended to control the symptoms of asthma. For children, low-dose inhaled corticosteroid is the preferred first-line treatment. Monotherapy with short-acting β-agonists is strongly discouraged. The WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases includes availability of affordable combination inhalers for asthma. Co-ordinated national asthma policies, ensuring access to inhalers, have resulted in fewer hospitalisations and school and work absences. Future asthma prevalence could be reduced by good maternal and infant care, with reduction in premature births and reduction in infant respiratory infections, and by reduction in obesity at all ages.",asthma characterise variable airflow obstruction associate symptom cough wheeze dyspnoea airway inflammation hyperresponsiveness approximately million people asthma worldwide despite current plateau burden disease likely increase population growth urbanisation ageing disease onset associate low birthweight preterm birth viral infection utero passive smoke exposure urbanisation occupational exposure obesity associate increase incidence severity asthma exposure small allergen particle lead severe disease adult adolescent inhale corticosteroid combination formoterol anti inflammatory reliever maintenance anti inflammatory reliever therapy widely recommend control symptom asthma child low dose inhaled corticosteroid preferred line treatment monotherapy short act β agonist strongly discourage global action plan prevention control non communicable disease include availability affordable combination inhaler asthma co ordinated national asthma policy ensure access inhaler result few hospitalisation school work absence future asthma prevalence reduce good maternal infant care reduction premature birth reduction infant respiratory infection reduction obesity age
Patient characteristics and outcomes of emergency visits in psoriatic arthritis: results from the U.S. Nationwide Emergency Department Sample.,"To evaluate patient characteristics and outcomes associated with emergency department (ED) visits in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) using the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), the largest all-payer U.S. ED database. We analyzed 2019 NEDS data for adults aged ≥ 18 years with and without PsA per International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Baseline demographics, clinical comorbidities, and primary ED diagnoses were compared between PsA and non-PsA ED visits cross-sectionally. We assessed the top three primary diagnoses associated with inpatient admission among PsA ED visits. Pearson chi squared tests were used to compare categorical variables and t-tests to compare continuous variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with inpatient admission. Among 117,359,429 ED visits, 61,079 (0.05%) involved PsA patients (mean age 58.9 ± 15.2 years, 59.6% female, 84.2% non-Hispanic White, 47.4% Medicare-insured). Compared to non-PsA visits, PsA visits involved older patients, higher Medicare usage (30.1% vs. 47.4%), and a greater admission frequency (54.6% vs. 17.0%). Top diagnoses linked to admission in PsA patients were septicemia, skin and subcutaneous infections, and heart failure. Factors increasing the odds of admission included older age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.03), alcohol use disorders (OR 3.43, CI 2.67-4.41), chronic kidney disease (OR 2.23, CI 1.89-2.64), obesity (OR 2.32, CI 2.05-2.64), and stroke (OR 4.83, CI 3.02-7.72). PsA ED visits were characterized by older, non-Hispanic White patients, with over half requiring admission. Differences in age and comorbidity burden between patients with and without PsA may explain some of the findings. Key Points • We used a large U.S. database to assess ED utilization and outcomes in PsA patients. • Older age, comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors influence inpatient admission odds in patients with PsA. • Findings highlight health disparities, emphasizing the need for interventions to improve PsA patient outcomes.",evaluate patient characteristic outcome associate emergency department ed visit psoriatic arthritis psa nationwide emergency department sample ned large payer ed database analyze ned datum adult age year psa international classification disease icd code baseline demographic clinical comorbiditie primary ed diagnosis compare psa non psa ed visit cross sectionally assess primary diagnosis associate inpatient admission psa ed visit pearson chi square test compare categorical variable t test compare continuous variable multivariable logistic regression identify factor associate inpatient admission ed visit involve psa patient mean age year female non hispanic white medicare insure compare non psa visit psa visit involve old patient high medicare usage great admission frequency diagnosis link admission psa patient septicemia skin subcutaneous infection heart failure factor increase odd admission include old age ci alcohol use disorder ci chronic kidney disease ci obesity ci stroke ci psa ed visit characterize old non hispanic white patient half require admission difference age comorbidity burden patient psa explain finding key point large database assess ed utilization outcome psa patient old age comorbiditie socioeconomic factor influence inpatient admission odd patient psa finding highlight health disparity emphasize need intervention improve psa patient outcome
Exploring the obesity parADOX: A multisystem review.,"Obesity has plagued the entire world and is a known risk factor across the spectrum of diseases involving neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and hematological and is commonly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Obesity paradox is a concept that contradicts the prevailing medical knowledge by proposing the notion that obese patients have better mortality, morbidity, and survival rates when compared to the non-obese patient population suffering with the similar medical conditions. Although observed more commonly in patients with cardiovascular diseases, more research is coming forward citing the similar effects in critically ill patients, those with chronic kidney disease, end stage renal disease, and cancer patients. Despite extensive research, the underlying mechanisms of the Obesity Paradox remain unclear, complicated by the reliance on BMI and the neglect of confounding factors like age, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and one of the commonly proposed solutions is to make use of other anthropological indices of obesity. This calls for a more in-depth dive into this issue to find an explanation behind this paradox or even more to confirm if it actually exists.",obesity plague entire world know risk factor spectrum disease involve neurological cardiovascular pulmonary gastrointestinal hematological commonly associate poor clinical outcome obesity paradox concept contradict prevail medical knowledge propose notion obese patient well mortality morbidity survival rate compare non obese patient population suffer similar medical condition observe commonly patient cardiovascular disease research come forward cite similar effect critically ill patient chronic kidney disease end stage renal disease cancer patient despite extensive research underlie mechanism obesity paradox remain unclear complicated reliance bmi neglect confound factor like age comorbiditie socioeconomic status commonly propose solution use anthropological index obesity call depth dive issue find explanation paradox confirm actually exist
"Screening for Modifiable Risk Factors of Noncommunicable Diseases in Urban Young Adults, Indore, 2023-2024.","Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) lead to huge mortality in the population under 70 years of age at a global level. A national program called the National Programme for Prevention and Control of NCDs (NPNCD), targeting mainly individuals over 30 years of age, has been launched in India. Nearly 200 million Indians are young adults (ages 18-30 years). The levels of modifiable risk factors in this young adult population, as well as the prevalence of NCDs, remain undocumented. We conducted this study to identify the extent of modifiable risk factors among individuals aged 18-30 years in Indore. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Indore between 2023 and 2024. We planned to screen 10,000 young adults, based on a pre-calculated sample size table, by organizing camps in educational institutes. The paper-based tool collected data on sociodemography, behavioral risk factors, family history, dietary recall, and anthropometry. The samples were tested in a National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL)-accredited lab in Indore. The biochemical tests conducted were fasting blood glucose, total serum cholesterol, serum creatinine, and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). We performed descriptive epidemiology and analyzed the data for correlation using the chi-square test. The median (range) age of screened individuals was 20 (18-30) years. The median (IQR) BMI was 20 (18-22.4). Approximately 46% (4607) of individuals had elevated systolic blood pressure. Among females, 44% (2483) had elevated systolic blood pressure, whereas it was 50% (2199) among males. Abnormal blood glucose levels were observed in 4.0% (398), abnormal cholesterol levels in 5.3% (528), abnormal creatinine levels in 4.9% (491), and abnormal SGPT levels in 8.1% (809). The p-value for the correlation between tobacco consumption and elevated blood pressure, serum creatinine, serum cholesterol, and SGPT was <.05. Approximately 25% of the screened individuals were classified as underweight, while fewer than 25% were overweight. About 50% exhibit hypertension, with a higher prevalence in males. Individuals who have elevated blood pressure, serum creatinine, cholesterol, and SGPT levels exhibit an increased likelihood of tobacco consumption. We need to screen more young adults for modifiable risk factors and develop strategies to help them in mitigating these risks.",noncommunicable disease ncds lead huge mortality population year age global level national program call national programme prevention control ncds npncd target mainly individual year age launch india nearly million indians young adult age year level modifiable risk factor young adult population prevalence ncds remain undocumented conduct study identify extent modifiable risk factor individual age year indore conduct cross sectional study indore plan screen young adult base pre calculated sample size table organize camp educational institute paper base tool collect datum sociodemography behavioral risk factor family history dietary recall anthropometry sample test national accreditation board testing calibration laboratory lab indore biochemical test conduct fast blood glucose total serum cholesterol serum creatinine serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase sgpt perform descriptive epidemiology analyze datum correlation chi square test median range age screen individual year median iqr bmi approximately individual elevate systolic blood pressure female elevate systolic blood pressure male abnormal blood glucose level observe abnormal cholesterol level abnormal creatinine level abnormal sgpt level p value correlation tobacco consumption elevated blood pressure serum creatinine serum cholesterol sgpt approximately screened individual classify underweight few overweight exhibit hypertension high prevalence male individual elevate blood pressure serum creatinine cholesterol sgpt level exhibit increase likelihood tobacco consumption need screen young adult modifiable risk factor develop strategy help mitigate risk
"The Association of Eating Behaviours, and Self-Concept, With Weight Status of Indian Adolescents.","The epidemiological and sociocultural context of Indian adolescents is rapidly changing, thus affecting their eating behaviours and increasing overweight and obesity prevalence. The current study was aimed at exploring associations of problematic eating behaviours and self-concept with overweight/obesity in adolescents. This cross-sectional study was conducted in six schools in Punjab, India, and enrolled 538 randomly selected adolescents aged 10-16 years. The cut-off of > 23rd adult equivalent BMI for overweight/obesity and < 23rd adult equivalent for healthy weight (IAP, 2015) was used. The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised 18-item version and Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale were used. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to quantify linear relationships among eating behaviours, self-concept and BMI-based weight status. An independent t-test was applied to determine eating behaviour and self-concept variations. Eating behaviour such as cognitive restraint showed a statistically significant positive correlation with BMI in adolescents (p ≤ 0.001). Higher cognitive restraint significantly increased the probability of being overweight/obese (odds ratio [OR] = 1.153; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.097-1.211). Physical appearance (PHY) and happiness and satisfaction (HAP) domains of adolescents' self-concept showed a significant negative correlation with BMI. In girls, the domain of social acceptance (SOC) showed a significant negative correlation with BMI. The study highlights the relationship of overweight/obesity with certain aspects of problematic eating behaviours as well as self-concept in adolescents. These findings warrant further longitudinal studies to establish causality, which may provide a comprehensive understanding of the epidemic of adolescent overweight/obesity in India.",epidemiological sociocultural context indian adolescent rapidly change affect eat behaviour increase overweight obesity prevalence current study aim explore association problematic eat behaviour self concept overweight obesity adolescent cross sectional study conduct school punjab india enrol randomly select adolescent age year cut adult equivalent bmi overweight obesity adult equivalent healthy weight iap factor eat questionnaire revise item version pier harris self concept scale pearson correlation coefficient quantify linear relationship eat behaviour self concept bmi base weight status independent t test apply determine eat behaviour self concept variation eat behaviour cognitive restraint show statistically significant positive correlation bmi adolescent p high cognitive restraint significantly increase probability overweight obese odd ratio confidence interval ci physical appearance phy happiness satisfaction hap domain adolescent self concept show significant negative correlation bmi girl domain social acceptance soc show significant negative correlation bmi study highlight relationship overweight obesity certain aspect problematic eating behaviour self concept adolescent finding warrant longitudinal study establish causality provide comprehensive understanding epidemic adolescent overweight obesity india
"Marine Species, Metabolites and Macromolecules as Potential Therapeutics Against Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD): A Comprehensive Review.","Many metabolic diseases, such as Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), are largely caused by obesity, a complicated ailment characterized by excessive fat buildup. By 2030, obesity is expected to have increased in prevalence, affecting over 1 billion people worldwide. MASLD, formerly known as NAFLD, is a broad category of liver illnesses caused by metabolic dysfunction and frequently linked to obesity. Drugs are available for obesity, but long-term use causes serious adverse effects, as reported. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for MASLD. Interest in marine animals and their metabolites for their potential as therapeutics is growing, given the shortcomings of traditional medicines. This review emphasizes different marine species and metabolites, and macromolecules and tabulates all the pre-clinical studies targeting obesity and MASLD. For this review, the authors have gone through a vast number of article sources from different scientific databases like PubMed, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect. Algae, fungi, and bacteria found in the ocean are abundant in bioactive chemicals that have anti-obesity and anti-MASLD properties. A variety of studies have reported the anti-obesity and anti-MASLD effects of marine species such as Spirulina platensis, Chlorella vulgaris, Caulerpa okamurae, and bioactive macromolecules like dieckol, fucosterol, fucoxanthin, sodium alginate and paramylon. These marine-derived substances have a variety of pharmacological characteristics, including lipid-modulating, anti-adipogenic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. These qualities are crucial for treating the underlying mechanisms that underlie obesity and MASLD. These marine species may be useful as natural supplements or therapeutic agents in the management and treatment of metabolic diseases associated with obesity. Some of these bioactive phytoconstituents have been identified for their potential against obesity and MASLD; however, more investigation is necessary to identify the precise bioactive substances causing these advantageous effects and assess their safety and effectiveness in clinical trials.",metabolic disease metabolic dysfunction associate steatotic liver disease masld largely cause obesity complicated ailment characterize excessive fat buildup obesity expect increase prevalence affect billion people worldwide masld know nafld broad category liver illness cause metabolic dysfunction frequently link obesity drug available obesity long term use cause adverse effect report currently fda approve therapy masld interest marine animal metabolite potential therapeutic grow give shortcoming traditional medicine review emphasize different marine specie metabolite macromolecule tabulate pre clinical study target obesity masld review author go vast number article source different scientific database like pubmed google scholar sciencedirect algae fungus bacteria find ocean abundant bioactive chemical anti obesity anti masld property variety study report anti obesity anti masld effect marine specie spirulina platensis chlorella vulgaris caulerpa okamurae bioactive macromolecule like dieckol fucosterol fucoxanthin sodium alginate paramylon marine derive substance variety pharmacological characteristic include lipid modulating anti adipogenic antioxidant anti inflammatory activity quality crucial treat underlie mechanism underlie obesity masld marine specie useful natural supplement therapeutic agent management treatment metabolic disease associate obesity bioactive phytoconstituent identify potential obesity masld investigation necessary identify precise bioactive substance cause advantageous effect assess safety effectiveness clinical trial
Prediabetes.,"Prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycaemia represents a preliminary stage in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to an increased likelihood of developing T2DM, individuals with prediabetes have an elevated risk of various vascular and non-vascular complications. No consensus has been achieved on the ideal screening strategy for prediabetes, with fasting plasma glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the oral glucose tolerance test being the most frequently measured parameters. The two major phenotypes of prediabetes, that is, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, may represent different pathophysiologies with varying natural history, risk of adverse outcomes and responsiveness to treatment. Most of the evidence for managing prediabetes focuses on lifestyle modification with or without medications in individuals with overweight or obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Whether these interventions are beneficial in individuals with impaired fasting glucose and those of normal body weight is unclear, as is the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of pharmacotherapy for treating prediabetes. Large-scale national T2DM prevention programmes are currently under way to assess whether the benefits of interventions for prediabetes can be translated to the community setting.",prediabete intermediate hyperglycaemia represent preliminary stage development type diabetes mellitus dm addition increase likelihood develop dm individual prediabete elevated risk vascular non vascular complication consensus achieve ideal screening strategy prediabete fast plasma glucose concentration glycate haemoglobin oral glucose tolerance test frequently measure parameter major phenotype prediabete impair fasting glucose impair glucose tolerance represent different pathophysiologie vary natural history risk adverse outcome responsiveness treatment evidence manage prediabete focus lifestyle modification medication individual overweight obesity impair glucose tolerance intervention beneficial individual impaired fasting glucose normal body weight unclear cost effectiveness sustainability pharmacotherapy treat prediabete large scale national dm prevention programme currently way assess benefit intervention prediabete translate community set
Novel data-driven pathophysiological phenotypes among women with prediabetes in an Indian population.,"Data on pathophysiological phenotypes for prediabetes in Indian ethnic populations are scarce. We investigated data-driven, pathophysiological phenotypes of prediabetes associated with the incidence of diabetes mellitus. We characterised pathophysiological prediabetes phenotypes in a survey sample (n = 1455), and its progression to diabetes at one year. Data-driven clusters were identified usingk-means cluster algorithm along with measures of glycaemia, adiposity, dyslipidaemia, beta-cell function, insulin resistance and blood pressure. Logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the risk of diabetes incidence. Four distinct pathophysiological prediabetes phenotypes were identified: Phenotype 1 (Combined Insulin Resistant and Deficient Prediabetes - CIRDP) [n = 323, 22.2 %]; Phenotype 2 (Severe Insulin Resistant Obese Prediabetes - SIROP) [n = 290, 19.9 %]; Phenotype 3 (Severe Insulin Deficient Prediabetes - SIDP) [n = 544, 37.4 %] and Phenotype 4 (High Blood Pressure Moderate Insulin Deficient Prediabetes - HBPMIDP) [n = 298, 20.5 %]. At one year, the progression to diabetes was highest in Phenotype 1-CIRDP (OR: 6.07, 95 % CI: 3.59-10.65), followed by Phenotype 4-HBPMIDP (OR: 2.05, 95 % CI-1.10, 3.87) compared to Phenotype 3-SIDP after adjusting for age, BMI, educational and marital status. CIRDP and HBPMIDP had higher progression rates to diabetes at one year compared to SIDP.

"A Comprehensive Review of Acanthosis Nigricans: Pathogenesis, Clinical manifestation and Management.","Acanthosis Nigricans is a dermatological condition characterized by hyperpigmented velvet plaques that can be observed in flexural areas such as the neck, axilla, and groin. AN is frequently associated with insulin resistance and obesity, however, it can also appear in non-obese people and as a paraneoplastic disease. Its prevalence varies across different populations, with higher rates observed in individuals with obesity, diabetes, and certain genetic syndromes. Classification of AN can be based on underlying etiology, distinguishing primary and secondary forms. Pathogenesis is the complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors, with insulin resistance playing a central role. Diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation of characteristics of skin changes, often requiring further investigation for underlying systemic disease. Topical therapies involve keratolytic agents, retinoids, and alpha hydroxyl acids to improve the cosmesis and reduce the plaque's thickness. Treatment strategies address underlying conditions by emphasizing lifestyle modifications and in some cases, pharmacological interventions. This review aims to comprehensively examine the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and management of acanthosis nigricans. AN is closely linked to insulin resistance, characterized by impaired cellular response to insulin, leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Recognizing AN's clinical presentation is paramount for early diagnosis and appropriate management. Acanthosis Nigricans is a skin condition characterized by dark, thickened patches of skin, typically occurring in skin folds and creases. It can be a sign of an underlying health issue such as insulin resistance, obesity, hormonal disorders, or certain medications. Proper diagnosis and management of the underlying conditions are crucial. Treatment may involve addressing the underlying causes, lifestyle changes, and topical medications to improve the appearance of the skin.

Patient-size based dose optimization in projection radiography examinations: A BMI-guided approach.,"The increasing prevalence of obesity poses challenges for dose optimization in projection radiography due to greater anatomical thickness in overweight and obese patients worldwide. Diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) alone may not adequately account for variations in body habitus, potentially leading to suboptimal patient protection. This study aimed to explore benchmark doses (BMDs) based on patient body mass index (BMI) for projection radiography examinations of major anatomical regions in Sri Lanka, providing a complementary approach for dose optimization alongside DRLs. This prospective study included 1989 adult patients (≥18 years) undergoing abdomen anteroposterior (AP), chest posteroanterior (PA), kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) AP, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine lateral (LAT), and pelvis AP examinations at six major tertiary care hospitals. For each examination, patient demographics (age, weight, height, and BMI) and exposure parameters (kilovoltage peak [kVp] and tube current-exposure time product [mAs]) were recorded, and the patient doses in terms of kerma-area product (P<sub>KA</sub>) were measured using a P<sub>KA</sub> meter. DRLs (achievable doses) were proposed at the median of the median P<sub>KA</sub> distribution across hospitals for a standard-sized patient group (58 ± 20 kg). For BMI-based BMDs, patients were classified into four standard BMI categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. The median P<sub>KA</sub> distributions across hospitals were used to formulate BMI-based BMDs, which were then compared with the proposed DRLs for the standard-sized patient group. The results showed a progressive increase in BMI-based BMDs across BMI categories for all examinations studied. BMI-based BMDs (in Gy.cm<sup>2</sup>) for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese patients were as follows: 1.46, 1.94, 2.88, 3.00 (abdomen AP); 0.17, 0.21, 0.22, 0.25 (chest PA); 1.70, 1.76, 2.30, 3.60 (KUB AP); 1.00, 1.03, 1.29, 1.48 (lumbar spine AP); 1.94, 2.09, 2.57, 2.56 (lumbar spine LAT); and 0.60, 1.85, 1.86, 2.24 (pelvis AP). Compared to normal weight patients, underweight patients exhibited percentage reductions in BMI-based BMDs of 24.7%, 3.4%, 2.9%, 7.1%, 4.5%, and 67.6% for abdomen AP, KUB AP, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT, chest PA, and pelvis AP, respectively. Conversely, overweight patients demonstrated percentage increases of 48.5%, 30.7%, 25.2%, 23.0%, 4.8%, and 0.5% across the same examinations, while obese patients showed increases of 54.6%, 104.5%, 51.5%, 22.5%, 19.0%, and 21.1%, respectively. DRLs for the standard-sized patient group were 1.82, 0.22, 2.03, 1.27, 2.21, and 1.90 Gy.cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of BMI-based BMDs as an effective tool for personalized dose optimization, accounting for variations in patient body habitus. Their integration into clinical practice, alongside DRLs, could enhance patient protection and promote good radiographic practices. Furthermore, the findings underscore the need for the introduction of international guidelines for DRLs in intervals of BMI to ensure standardized implementation across countries.",increase prevalence obesity pose challenge dose optimization projection radiography great anatomical thickness overweight obese patient worldwide diagnostic reference level drl adequately account variation body habitus potentially lead suboptimal patient protection study aim explore benchmark dose bmds base patient body mass index bmi projection radiography examination major anatomical region sri lanka provide complementary approach dose optimization alongside drl prospective study include adult patient year undergo abdomen anteroposterior ap chest posteroanterior pa kidney ureter bladder kub ap lumbar spine ap lumbar spine lateral lat pelvis ap examination major tertiary care hospital examination patient demographic age weight height bmi exposure parameter kilovoltage peak kvp tube current exposure time product mas record patient dose term kerma area product p sub measure p sub meter drl achievable dose propose median median p sub distribution hospital standard sized patient group kg bmi base bmds patient classify standard bmi category underweight normal weight overweight obese median p sub distribution hospital formulate bmi base bmds compare propose drl standard sized patient group result show progressive increase bmi base bmds bmi category examination study bmi base bmds underweight normal weight overweight obese patient follow abdomen ap chest pa kub ap lumbar spine ap lumbar spine lat pelvis ap compare normal weight patient underweight patient exhibit percentage reduction bmi base bmds abdomen ap kub ap lumbar spine ap lumbar spine lat chest pa pelvis ap respectively conversely overweight patient demonstrate percentage increase examination obese patient show increase respectively drl standard sized patient group respectively finding underscore importance bmi base bmds effective tool personalized dose optimization account variation patient body habitus integration clinical practice alongside drl enhance patient protection promote good radiographic practice furthermore finding underscore need introduction international guideline drl interval bmi ensure standardized implementation country
